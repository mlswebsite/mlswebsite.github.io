                <blockquote>
<p>Dominique Francon loves Roark, yet she struggles to destroy his career. Why? What does she come to understand over the course of the novel that ultimately convinces her to change her mind? How does this conflict of hers relate to the novel’s theme and meaning? In your answer, refer to both The Fountainhead and “Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition” of The Fountainhead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dominique is a conflicted character that pursues her idealism yet is confined to the world by her pessimism. She loves Roark, because he embodies everything she values: greatness, purity, desire, and freedom from social constraints. Dominique admires his greatness, although it is for the same reason that she attempts to destroy his career. She believes that greatness is doomed to fail, to be corrupted by the mediocre, so that’s why she destroys his career.</p>
<p>Her destruction of Roark’s career cannot be considered as betrayal or conflict- it is protection. She destroys his career for a similar reason she chooses to destroy that statue during the conversation with Scarret. She acknowledges that what she loves is pure, but she doesn’t want the mediocre to taint it, so she smashes the statue as an act of protection. She chooses to take clients away from Roark in a way of protection- she believes that in doing so, Roark will ‘belong’ to her. Roark’s integrity will be preserved, he will be untainted from the corrupt world, like the statue. However, she doesn’t take things away from him fundamentally, she merely takes out clients who is unworthy of his work: ones who are easily swayed by popular opinion, who cannot stay true to themselves or acknowledge what they want. Like that statue, she can’t bear Roark turning famous and falling into the hands of mediocrity, so she attempts to destroy Roark in order to protect him from the society. Even though she loves and supports Roark, her actions reflect her belief that the world will also corrupt the ideal, and destruction is the only way to preserve it.</p>
<p>Over the course of the novel, Dominique gradually realize that her fundamental belief is incorrect. Even though she tries to take clients away from Roark, she still sees him take commissions, and understand that she cannot fully destroy greatness, greatness is not doomed to be corrupt by the mediocre. Her transformation begins when she helps Roark blow up Cortlandt Homes. When Roark faces trial, she comes to understand that no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way of greatness, it does not shake the core fundamentally, it will matter ‘only to a certain point’.</p>
<p>The key moment comes when she and Gail Wynand defends Roark in The Banner. As public backlash grows, Wynand caves in to pressure, ultimately sacrificing Roark in order to keep The Banner. Dominique sees that Wynand, despite his power, is still controlled by the world. At this point, Dominique truly realizes that earth has no other meaning than a ‘mere background’- Wynand could choose to ignore such voices and close The Banner, yet he chooses to comply to the society’s demands. Dominique finally sees that it is Roark who is truly free: his ignorance of the world makes him free, because he isn’t attached to gain society’s approval. Witnessing, and fully understanding Roark’s independence, Dominique sees that greatness cannot be doomed- it is indestructible.</p>
<p>Inspired by Roark, she chooses to pursue happiness in her life, to appreciate greatness and embrace her ideals fully. She no longer tries to punish herself nor destroy Roark, she stands together with Roark before the trial on Cortlandt Homes ends.</p>
<p>Dominique&rsquo;s conflict and development reflects the battle of individualism and
collectivism. At the start of the novel, Dominique is torn between the belief that greatness
cannot win and the appreciation of beauty. Her pursuit for her ideals reflect the strive for
greatness- what Rand calls &lsquo;man-worship&rsquo;, trying to free herself from the world. Yet her
attempts in sabotaging Roark&rsquo;s career and denying her of happiness reflects her belief that
greatness is doomed to fail in a corrupt world. By attempting to destroy Roark&rsquo;s career
through taking his clients, she unintentionally treats Roark&rsquo;s success dependent through
measures of the society (material wealth and power). She tries to confine Roark by
excluding her from the society, rid of commissions, however, she cannot grasp that the
strength of Roark lies precisely in his refusal to seek validation from others.</p>
<p>In this way, Dominique&rsquo;s journey portrays how individualism overcomes collectivism. She begins by unconsciously relying on society&rsquo;s judgements to justify her despair, but she ends by detaching from those judgements entirely. When she recognizes that greatness can lead to success in the world by ignoring the voice of society, she realizes that she is truly free. She too, detaches from the world when she comes to stand with Roark before the trial ends, pursuing her ideals and truly finding happiness.</p>
<p>Dominique’s arc also reflects the triumph of the individual, the process of mankind morphing into a noble soul. Rand writes that The Fountainhead is about presenting the ideal man- independent, detached from social pressures, and respects themselves. Dominique experiences such revolution when she witnesses Roark ‘hold on and move on’ during societal pressure, unable to be corrupted by the mediocre. Dominique is one of the people who Rand quotes in her introduction, referring to as those who ‘grasps and achieve the full reality of man’s proper stature’. Through Roark, Dominique learns that the individual –when truly independent- can triumph. Her transformation reflects Rand’s belief in the power of human greatness, and her revelation embodies the victory of the ideal man.</p>
<p>Thought Process：</p>
<p>Why does she try to destroy roark? (prevent roark from being destroyed- takes clients away from him, yet doesn’t take things fundamentally)
Keating is what the society values
Tries to stop roark, yet realizes he’s getting things done anyway.
Stofordd lawsuit- back from marrying people.</p>
<p>Her fundamental perspective is incorrect- greatness is not doomed to be destroyed. She see Roark still succeed – ignorance of the world. Fundamentally independent of other worlds
Gail wynand – thoughts he rules the world yet he’s still dependent on the world</p>
<p>Why does she like the feeling of being dominated by roark?
Hates roark- feels desire for him, yet she feels tied to the world.
Why do they keep their relationship a secret&mdash;- to the question- why does she try to destroy him? (protection?)</p>
<p>Tries to do so as a denfence for roark- believes in doing so Roark will belong to her (the pureness in the world is for her to enjoy and secluded by others)
Ignorance feels like a solution
Why is she determined to make herself suffer?</p>
