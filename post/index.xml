        <title>《鼠疫》读后感</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;《鼠疫》是加缪写在一九四几年写的小说，讲述了一座小城市突然被鼠疫这个病入侵，封城后人们一系列的举动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鼠疫带来的不仅仅是病痛和死亡，还有对于在平庸的小镇过着平庸的生活的人们翻天覆地的变化。鼠疫的到来是荒谬的，疫情从简简单单一只死去的老鼠逐渐演变成了要封城的地步，人们离奇死亡；鼠疫的离开更是荒谬的，它看似随着时间的流逝消失的无影无踪；有些人幸运的从病痛中恢复了，有些人却为此付出了生命的代价。人们平庸的生活却被这一事件打破，在面对如此近距离的死亡后，他们逐渐开始思考生命的意义，开始思考如何面对“荒谬”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每个人物在面对此次疫情中的态度各不相同。帕纳鲁神父在最开始面对鼠疫时宣称人们‘罪有应得’，这是上帝给堕落的人们带来的惩罚，但在看到一个无辜的小孩饱受病痛的折磨并死去后，他的内心发生了极大的震撼。上帝是仁慈的，却眼睁睁的看着小孩逝去；这时他才面对了荒谬——世界并不会理会渺小的个体，在面对无数次呐喊仍默不作声。他对自己的信仰产生了极大的动摇，却仍坚定信念（如同克尔郭凯尔的信仰之跃）最终在这种状态下离奇死亡。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在面对鼠疫时，里厄医生和众多志愿者积极抗争。虽然里厄医生知道他的做法对解决这次灾难没有什么用，他却坚持救治。这于加缪所倡导面对荒谬的方式相似，让我想起了西西弗斯。在做的一切，整个世界都是荒谬的，但在荒谬之下，每个人的态度又不同。里厄医生与西西弗斯选择反抗，他们知道自己努力救治或将石头推上山后的最终结局是失败，但奋斗中（去救治，将石头推上山）的这种拼搏足以充实他们的内心，拾起对生活的希望。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;鼠疫像是加缪给世人们的一种启示。生命中充满了变化和偶然，但面对这种事件并不容易，可能会导致人们思考生活，质问生命的意义。当所有人发现生命无意义，面对的一切是荒谬后，又该如何反应？会崩溃还是会选择将信念寄托于飘渺，是会奋起反抗还是会丧失对生活的热爱？加缪在书中似乎给了人们一种借鉴方式，就是虽知道做的一切事情没有意义却仍然奋不顾身的去做，在拼搏的过程中感受到‘意义’，充足内心。在这种情况下，人们应当想象他们是幸福的。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pearl (Movie) Analysis</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/pearl-movie-analysis/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/pearl-movie-analysis/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;She is highly sympathetic yet also disturbingly unhinged. She’s trapped in a suffocating environment after the first world war, burdened with caring for her paralyzed father and living under her mother’s strict authority. Yet she dreams to be a star- a dancer that will one day famous, like such in the Hollywood movies.
At the beginning of the film, Pearl admires herself in the mirror. She believes that the image in the mirror (her ideal self) is the sweet, glamorous movie star (yet the role is acutally shaped by the American Dream). It kinda feels like ‘the mirror stage’ Lacan mentioned. During this stage, infants recognize themselves in the mirror. The reflected self appears whole and unified, but the actual self is fragmented and uncoordinated. From this gap, the infant constructs an ‘ideal ego,’ a seemingly complete and coherent self-image. Pearl believes that herself in the mirror is a star, yet it is found on misrecognition, as Pearl can never become the cinematic ideal she chases.  She refuses to believe it, yet her mother’s words and her failed audition keeps reminding her that she never will become the Hollywood star she imagines herself to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then identify her violent outbursts as an act to defend herself from her impossible pursuit. Each person she killed represents a different facet of the obstacles to her desired image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person she killed, the projectionist, tells her about a life free from constraints at first. He represents freedom, possibility, and encourages her by telling her she is deemed to become an actor. Yet when the projectionist sees her home, he starts questioning her ‘identity’ (Pearl’s house did seem really creepy, I felt like he was scared that she was a psycho) and tries to leave. She then kills him, and screams ‘You’re not leaving me’ (or something similar)- which I think means that she can’t bear seeing the projectionist, symbolizing ‘possibility and freedom’ run away from her. It feels as if the projectionist has ‘betrayed’ her, encouraging to ‘grant’ her freedom yet running away the second her sees the ‘real’ her, and her response to this betrayal was killing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving onto her family, she has a paralyzed father and a strict mother. I do understand her mother’s concerns about her auditioning, as they are German immigrants living in the US after the first world-war, which does not add on to the ‘all-American’ standard the judges look for. Her mother is sympathetic when seen as a woman who has endured similar struggles, yet her strictness and constant repression burdens Pearl, pushing her into rebellion, which results in brutal fights (and yes, she was pushed into the fire by Pearl). Unlike the projectionist, her father is an exaggerated visual representation of how trapped Pearl feels, by her family as he can’t be left alone, he has to be cared for, and by her town since they live on an isolated farm. Her family feels like a cage, a burden that physically and mentally traps her, and her way of dealing with such burden would be murdering them.
Her relationship with her cousin, Mitsy, is also interesting as Mitsy is the exact type of person Hollywood looks for: blonde, and a typical all-American sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the audition, Mitsy brings a devastated Pearl back home and attempts to console her. When Pearl asks if Mitsy got the role, Mitsy first denies it but then admits the truth. At this point, whether Mitsy actually got the role doesn’t matter—the important thing is that Pearl believes she did. When she was killing Mitsy, I think there could be two ways of interpretation, one being she’s jealous of Mitsy, so when she kills her it’s an image she’s killing, the image that the world prefers over her，or it could also represent the reality her mother was taunting her (the world’s view on her instability) with- so she’s killing her because she’s afraid of the fear coming true.
In a way, violence has become a way Pearl uses to force her fragmented reality into alignment with her fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearl is a great movie that could be interpreted in so many ways. It is a tragic and horrific story that moulds Pearl into a great character with a disturbing yet deep human complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Essay3</title>

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique Francon loves Roark, yet she struggles to destroy his career. Why? What does she come to understand over the course of the novel that ultimately convinces her to change her mind? How does this conflict of hers relate to the novel’s theme and meaning? In your answer, refer to both The Fountainhead and “Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition” of The Fountainhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique is a conflicted character that pursues her idealism yet is confined to the world by her pessimism. She loves Roark, because he embodies everything she values: greatness, purity, desire, and freedom from social constraints. Dominique admires his greatness, although it is for the same reason that she attempts to destroy his career. She believes that greatness is doomed to fail, to be corrupted by the mediocre, so that’s why she destroys his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her destruction of Roark’s career cannot be considered as betrayal or conflict- it is protection. She destroys his career for a similar reason she chooses to destroy that statue during the conversation with Scarret. She acknowledges that what she loves is pure, but she doesn’t want the mediocre to taint it, so she smashes the statue as an act of protection. She chooses to take clients away from Roark in a way of protection- she believes that in doing so, Roark will ‘belong’ to her. Roark’s integrity will be preserved, he will be untainted from the corrupt world, like the statue. However, she doesn’t take things away from him fundamentally, she merely takes out clients who is unworthy of his work: ones who are easily swayed by popular opinion, who cannot stay true to themselves or acknowledge what they want. Like that statue, she can’t bear Roark turning famous and falling into the hands of mediocrity, so she attempts to destroy Roark in order to protect him from the society. Even though she loves and supports Roark, her actions reflect her belief that the world will also corrupt the ideal, and destruction is the only way to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the novel, Dominique gradually realize that her fundamental belief is incorrect. Even though she tries to take clients away from Roark, she still sees him take commissions, and understand that she cannot fully destroy greatness, greatness is not doomed to be corrupt by the mediocre. Her transformation begins when she helps Roark blow up Cortlandt Homes. When Roark faces trial, she comes to understand that no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way of greatness, it does not shake the core fundamentally, it will matter ‘only to a certain point’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key moment comes when she and Gail Wynand defends Roark in The Banner. As public backlash grows, Wynand caves in to pressure, ultimately sacrificing Roark in order to keep The Banner. Dominique sees that Wynand, despite his power, is still controlled by the world. At this point, Dominique truly realizes that earth has no other meaning than a ‘mere background’- Wynand could choose to ignore such voices and close The Banner, yet he chooses to comply to the society’s demands. Dominique finally sees that it is Roark who is truly free: his ignorance of the world makes him free, because he isn’t attached to gain society’s approval. Witnessing, and fully understanding Roark’s independence, Dominique sees that greatness cannot be doomed- it is indestructible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Roark, she chooses to pursue happiness in her life, to appreciate greatness and embrace her ideals fully. She no longer tries to punish herself nor destroy Roark, she stands together with Roark before the trial on Cortlandt Homes ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique&amp;rsquo;s conflict and development reflects the battle of individualism and
collectivism. At the start of the novel, Dominique is torn between the belief that greatness
cannot win and the appreciation of beauty. Her pursuit for her ideals reflect the strive for
greatness- what Rand calls &amp;lsquo;man-worship&amp;rsquo;, trying to free herself from the world. Yet her
attempts in sabotaging Roark&amp;rsquo;s career and denying her of happiness reflects her belief that
greatness is doomed to fail in a corrupt world. By attempting to destroy Roark&amp;rsquo;s career
through taking his clients, she unintentionally treats Roark&amp;rsquo;s success dependent through
measures of the society (material wealth and power). She tries to confine Roark by
excluding her from the society, rid of commissions, however, she cannot grasp that the
strength of Roark lies precisely in his refusal to seek validation from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Dominique&amp;rsquo;s journey portrays how individualism overcomes collectivism. She begins by unconsciously relying on society&amp;rsquo;s judgements to justify her despair, but she ends by detaching from those judgements entirely. When she recognizes that greatness can lead to success in the world by ignoring the voice of society, she realizes that she is truly free. She too, detaches from the world when she comes to stand with Roark before the trial ends, pursuing her ideals and truly finding happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique’s arc also reflects the triumph of the individual, the process of mankind morphing into a noble soul. Rand writes that The Fountainhead is about presenting the ideal man- independent, detached from social pressures, and respects themselves. Dominique experiences such revolution when she witnesses Roark ‘hold on and move on’ during societal pressure, unable to be corrupted by the mediocre. Dominique is one of the people who Rand quotes in her introduction, referring to as those who ‘grasps and achieve the full reality of man’s proper stature’. Through Roark, Dominique learns that the individual –when truly independent- can triumph. Her transformation reflects Rand’s belief in the power of human greatness, and her revelation embodies the victory of the ideal man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does she try to destroy roark? (prevent roark from being destroyed- takes clients away from him, yet doesn’t take things fundamentally)
Keating is what the society values
Tries to stop roark, yet realizes he’s getting things done anyway.
Stofordd lawsuit- back from marrying people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her fundamental perspective is incorrect- greatness is not doomed to be destroyed. She see Roark still succeed – ignorance of the world. Fundamentally independent of other worlds
Gail wynand – thoughts he rules the world yet he’s still dependent on the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does she like the feeling of being dominated by roark?
Hates roark- feels desire for him, yet she feels tied to the world.
Why do they keep their relationship a secret&amp;mdash;- to the question- why does she try to destroy him? (protection?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tries to do so as a denfence for roark- believes in doing so Roark will belong to her (the pureness in the world is for her to enjoy and secluded by others)
Ignorance feels like a solution
Why is she determined to make herself suffer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful for the opportunity to read her books. Although I don’t fully agree with Rand’s philosophy, her books had pushed me to think. I can relate to Dominique’s pain as I also feel pain in my conflicting mind- Ayn Rand’s works and thoughts are inspiring, while I try my best to comprehend those, I also work hard to try to grasp her loop holes and criticize her reasoning. Rand encouraged me to think, and also brought a whole new perspective in understanding myself and the world, which I appreciate a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the contest sponsors for giving me such a valuable place to discuss my ideas and thoughts on the book. I’m truly grateful for the resources they gave me and how well it made me grow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/essay2/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition Many people have asked me how I feel about the fact that The Fountainhead has been in print for twenty-five years. I cannot say that I feel anything in particular, except a kind of quiet satisfaction. In this respect, my attitude toward my writing is best expressed by a statement of Victor Hugo: &amp;ldquo;If a writer wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain writers, of whom I am one, do not live, think or write on the range of the moment. Novels, in the proper sense of the word, are not written to vanish in a month or a year. That most of them do, today, that they are written and published as if they were magazines, to fade as rapidly, is one of the sorriest aspects of today&amp;rsquo;s literature, and one of the clearest indictments of its dominant esthetic philosophy: concrete-bound, journalistic Naturalism which has now reached its dead end in the inarticulate sounds of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longevity-predominantly, though not exclusively-is the prerogative of a literary school which is virtually non-existent today: Romanticism. This is not the place for a dissertation on the nature of Romantic fiction, so let me state&amp;ndash;for the record and for the benefit of those college students who have never been allowed to discover it&amp;ndash;only that Romanticism is the conceptual school of art. It deals, not with the random trivia of the day, but with the timeless, fundamental, universal problems and values of human existence. It does not record or photograph; it creates and projects. It is concerned&amp;ndash;in the words of Aristotle&amp;ndash;not with things as they are, but with things as they might be and ought to be.
And for the benefit of those who consider relevance to one&amp;rsquo;s own time as of crucial importance, I will add, in regard to our age, that never has there been a time when men have so desperately needed a projection of things as they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to imply that I knew, when I wrote it, that The Fountainhead would remain in print for twenty-five years. I did not think of any specific time period. I knew only that it was a book that ought to live. It did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that I knew it over twenty-five years ago&amp;ndash;that I knew it while The Fountainhead was being rejected by twelve publishers, some of whom declared that it was &amp;ldquo;too intellectual,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;too controversial&amp;rdquo; and would not sell because no audience existed for it&amp;ndash;that was the difficult part of its history; difficult for me to bear. I mention it here for the sake of any other writer of my kind who might have to face the same battle&amp;ndash;as a reminder of the fact that it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of its history without mentioning the man who made it possible for me to write it: my husband, Frank O&amp;rsquo;Connor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a play I wrote in my early thirties, Ideal, the heroine, a screen star, speaks for me when she says: &amp;ldquo;I want to see, real, living, and in the hours of my own days, that glory I create as an illusion. I want it real. I want to know that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too. Or else what is the use of seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? A spirit, too, needs fuel. It can run dry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank was the fuel. He gave me, in the hours of my own days, the reality of that sense of life, which created The Fountainhead&amp;ndash;and he helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion. The essence of the bond between us is the fact that neither of us has ever wanted or been tempted to settle for anything less than the world presented in The Fountainhead. We never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is in me any touch of the Naturalistic writer who records &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; dialogue for use in a novel, it has been exercised only in regard to Frank. For instance, one of the most effective lines in The Fountainhead comes at the end of Part II, when, in reply to Toohey&amp;rsquo;s question: &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you tell me what you think of me?&amp;rdquo; Roark answers: &amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t think of you.&amp;rdquo; That line was Frank&amp;rsquo;s answer to a different type of person, in a somewhat similar context. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re casting pearls without getting even a pork chop in return,&amp;rdquo; was said by Frank to me, in regard to my professional position. I gave that line to Dominique at Roark&amp;rsquo;s trial.
I did not feel discouragement very often, and when I did, it did not last longer than overnight. But there was one evening, during the writing of The Fountainhead, when I felt so profound an indignation at the state of &amp;ldquo;things as they are&amp;rdquo; that it seemed as if I would never regain the energy to move one step farther toward &amp;ldquo;things as they ought to be.&amp;rdquo; Frank talked to me for hours, that night. He convinced me of why one cannot give up the world to those one despises. By the time he finished, my discouragement was gone; it never came back in so intense a form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been opposed to the practice of dedicating books; I had held that a book is addressed to any reader who proves worthy of it. But, that night, I told Frank that I would dedicate The Fountainhead to him because he had saved it. And one of my happiest moments, about two years later, was given to me by the look on his face when he came home, one day, and saw the page-proofs of the book, headed by the page that stated in cold, clear, objective print: To Frank O&amp;rsquo;Connor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked whether I have changed in these past twenty-five years. No, I am the same&amp;ndash;only more so. Have my ideas changed? No, my fundamental convictions, my view of life and of man, have never changed, from as far back as I can remember, but my knowledge of their applications has grown, in scope and in precision. What is my present evaluation of The Fountainhead? I am as proud of it as I was on the day when I finished writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? Here, I shall quote from The Goal of My Writing, an address I gave at Lewis and Clark College, on October 1, 1963: &amp;ldquo;This is the motive and purpose of my writing; the projection of an ideal man. The portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal, as an end in itself&amp;ndash;to which any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means. &amp;quot;
Let me stress this: my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers&amp;hellip;My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark [or the heroes of Atlas Shrugged] as an end in himself&amp;hellip;
&amp;ldquo;I write&amp;ndash;and read&amp;ndash;for the sake of the story&amp;hellip;My basic test for any story is: &amp;lsquo;Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself?&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man, I had to define and present the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires. Since man&amp;rsquo;s character is the product of his premises, I had to define and present the kinds of premises and values that create the character of an ideal man and motivate his actions; which means that I had to define and present a rational code of ethics. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to present the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to exist and to function&amp;ndash;a free, productive, rational system which demands and rewards the best in every man, and which is, obviously, laissez-faire capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy is an end in itself, neither in life nor in literature. Only Man is an end in himself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any substantial changes I would want to make in The Fountainhead? No&amp;ndash;and, therefore, I have left its text untouched. I want it to stand as it was written. But there is one minor error and one possibly misleading sentence which I should like to clarify, so I shall mention them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error is semantic: the use of the word &amp;ldquo;egotist&amp;rdquo; in Roark&amp;rsquo;s courtroom speech, while actually the word should have been &amp;ldquo;egoist.&amp;rdquo; The error was caused by my reliance on a dictionary which gave such misleading definitions of these two words that &amp;ldquo;egotist&amp;rdquo; seemed closer to the meaning I intended (Webster&amp;rsquo;s Daily Use Dictionary, 1933). (Modern philosophers, however, are guiltier than lexicographers in regard to these two terms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibly misleading sentence is in Roark&amp;rsquo;s speech: &amp;ldquo;From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man&amp;ndash;the function of his reasoning mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of religion or religious ideas. I remember hesitating over that sentence, when I wrote it, and deciding that Roark&amp;rsquo;s and my atheism, as well as the overall spirit of the book, were so clearly established that no one would misunderstand it, particularly since I said that religious abstractions are the product of man&amp;rsquo;s of man&amp;rsquo;s mind, not of supernatural revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an issue of this sort should not be left to implications. What I was referring to was not religion as such, but a special category of abstractions, the most exalted one, which, for centuries, had been the near-monopoly of religion: ethics&amp;ndash;not the particular content of religious ethics, but the abstraction &amp;ldquo;ethics,&amp;rdquo; the realm of values, man&amp;rsquo;s code of good and evil, with the emotional connotations of height, uplift, nobility, reverence, grandeur, which pertain to the realm of man&amp;rsquo;s values, but which religion has arrogated to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same meaning and considerations were intended and are applicable to another passage of the book, a brief dialogue between Roark and Hopton Stoddard, which may be misunderstood if taken out of context: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a profoundly religious man, Mr. Roark&amp;ndash;in your own way. I can see that in your buildings.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;That&amp;rsquo;s true,&amp;rsquo; said Roark.&amp;rdquo; In the context of that scene, however, the meaning is clear: it is Roark&amp;rsquo;s profound dedication to values, to the highest and best, to the ideal, that Stoddard is referring to (see his explanation of the nature of the proposed temple). The erection of the Stoddard Temple and the subsequent trial state the issue explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to a wider issue which is involved in every line of The Fountainhead and which has to be understood if one wants to understand the causes of its lasting appeal. Religion&amp;rsquo;s monopoly in the field of ethics has made it extremely difficult to communicate the emotional meaning and connotations of a rational view of life. Just as religion has preempted the field of ethics, turning morality against man, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language, placing them outside this earth and beyond man&amp;rsquo;s reach. &amp;ldquo;Exaltation&amp;rdquo; is usually taken to mean an emotional state evoked by contemplating the supernatural. &amp;ldquo;Worship&amp;rdquo; means the emotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man. &amp;ldquo;Reverence&amp;rdquo; means the emotion of a sacred respect, to be experienced on one&amp;rsquo;s knees. &amp;ldquo;Sacred&amp;rdquo; means superior to and not-to-be-touched-by any concerns of man or of this earth. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such concepts do name actual emotions, even though no supernatural dimension exists; and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling, without the self-abasement required by religious definitions. What, then, is their source or referent in reality? It is the entire emotional realm of man&amp;rsquo;s dedication to a moral ideal. Yet apart from the man-degrading aspects introduced by religion, that emotional realm is left unidentified, without concepts, words or recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this highest level of man&amp;rsquo;s emotions that has to be redeemed from the murk of mysticism and redirected at its proper object: man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this sense, with this meaning and intention, that I would identify the sense of life dramatized in The Fountainhead as man-worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an emotion that a few&amp;ndash;a very few&amp;ndash;men experience consistently; some men experience it in rare, single sparks that flash and die without consequences; some do not know what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not confuse &amp;ldquo;man-worship&amp;rdquo; with the many attempts, not to emancipate morality from religion and bring it into the realm of reason, but to substitute a secular meaning for the worst, the most profoundly irrational elements of religion. For instance, there are all the variants of modern collectivism (communist, fascist, Nazi, etc.), which preserve the religious-altruist ethics in full and merely substitute &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rdquo; for God as the beneficiary of man&amp;rsquo;s self-immolation. There are the various schools of modern philosophy which, rejecting the law of identity, proclaim that reality is an indeterminate flux ruled by miracles and shaped by whims&amp;ndash; not God&amp;rsquo;s whims, but man&amp;rsquo;s or &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo; These neo-mystics are not man-worshipers; they are merely the secularizers of as profound a hatred for man as that of their avowedly mystic predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cruder variant of the same hatred is represented by those concrete-bound, &amp;ldquo;statistical&amp;rdquo; mentalities who&amp;ndash;unable to grasp the meaning of man&amp;rsquo;s volition&amp;ndash;declare that man cannot be an object of worship, since they have never encountered any specimens of humanity who deserved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see man&amp;rsquo;s highest potential and strive to actualize it. The man-haters are those who regard man as a helpless, depraved, contemptible creature&amp;ndash;and struggle never to let him discover otherwise. It is important here to remember that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the essential division between these two camps is: those dedicated to the exaltation of man&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem and the sacredness of his happiness on earth&amp;ndash;and those determined not to allow either to become possible. The majority of mankind spend their lives and psychological energy in the middle, swinging between these two, struggling not to allow the issue to be named. This does not change the nature of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best way to communicate The Fountainhead&amp;rsquo;s sense of life is by means of the quotation which had stood at the head of my manuscript, but which I removed from the final, published book. With this opportunity to explain it, I am glad to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed it, because of my profound disagreement with the philosophy of its author, Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic and an irrationalist. His metaphysics consists of a somewhat &amp;ldquo;Byronic&amp;rdquo; and mystically &amp;ldquo;malevolent&amp;rdquo; universe; his epistemology subordinates reason to &amp;ldquo;will,&amp;rdquo; or feeling or instinct or blood or innate virtues of character. But, as a poet, he projects at times (not consistently) a magnificent feeling for man&amp;rsquo;s greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of the quotation I had chosen. I could not endorse its literal meaning: it proclaims an indefensible tenet&amp;ndash;psychological determinism. But if one takes it as a poetic projection of an emotional experience (and if, intellectually, one substitutes the concept of an acquired &amp;ldquo;basic premise&amp;rdquo; for the concept of an innate &amp;ldquo;fundamental certainty&amp;rdquo;), then that quotation communicates the inner state of an exalted self-esteem&amp;ndash;and sums up the emotional consequences for which The Fountainhead provides the rational, philosophical base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is not the works, but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank&amp;ndash;to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning,&amp;ndash;it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.&amp;ndash;The noble soul has reverence for itself.&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; (Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view of man has rarely been expressed in human history. Today, it is virtually nonexistent. Yet this is the view with which&amp;ndash;in various degrees of longing, wistfulness, passion and agonized confusion&amp;ndash;the best of mankind&amp;rsquo;s youth start out in life. It is not even a view, for most of them, but a foggy, groping, undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. It is a sense of enormous expectation, the sense that one&amp;rsquo;s life is important, that great achievements are within one&amp;rsquo;s capacity, and that great things lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not in the nature of man&amp;ndash;nor of any living entity&amp;ndash;to start out by giving up, by spitting in one&amp;rsquo;s own face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man. Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning one&amp;rsquo;s mind; security, of abandoning one&amp;rsquo;s values; practicality, of losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek a noble vision of man&amp;rsquo;s nature and of life&amp;rsquo;s potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few guideposts to find. The Fountainhead is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the cardinal reasons of The Fountainhead&amp;rsquo;s lasting appeal: it is a confirmation of the spirit of youth, proclaiming man&amp;rsquo;s glory, showing how much is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of man&amp;rsquo;s proper stature&amp;ndash;and that the rest will betray it. It is those few that move the world and give life its meaning&amp;ndash;and it is those few that I have always sought to address. The rest are no concern of mine; it is not me or The Fountainhead that they will betray: it is their own souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AYN RAND New York, May 1968&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the “Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition” of The Fountainhead (which you can find at the very beginning on your copy of The Fountainhead). Judging from that ‘Introduction,’ what factor(s) motivate and enable some people to hold on to their ideals — even in circumstances that seem hostile to them? Support your answer with examples from that ‘Introduction.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who hold on to their ideals in hostile circumstances are motivated by their unwavering self-belief and enabled by their autonomy. In the introduction, Rand recalls being rejected by 12 publishers; however, she insists that her book was one that ‘ought to live’, driving her persistence, eventually gaining wide acclaim for her book. Rand’s enduring faith in her book was her driving force. Yet such perseverance can only be sustained by her independence - rejecting external authority. Rand criticizes religion for monopolizing emotions towards the supernatural, and degrading humanity, arguing that these emotions should be redirected toward man’s own strive for greatness rather than the greater good or God. Quoting Nietzsche, ‘the noble sole has reverence for itself’, Rand claims that individuals who are noble do not rely on validation from the society, but rather from their internal conviction. Rand’s protagonist, Howard Roark, is considered as noble, because he honors his work and do not compromise for others. He chooses to work for little to no pay rather than conform his architectural design to the public taste. The rejection of compromising illustrates how self-autonomy liberates individuals from the pressure of others. Rand’s claims ‘only Man is an end in himself’, rejecting religious and collectivist demands on self-sacrifice, focusing more on individual autonomy. By rejecting external perspectives, individuals shield themselves from pressures to conform and remain true to their inner selves and beliefs. In conclusion, the ability to maintain ideals against hostility stems from independence, avoiding to conform with external pressures, and is motivated by the faith in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her enduring belief in her book is what motivates her and keeps her going, even in harsh circumstances like unable to publish her books, she eventually makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He rose, beamed and held Dominique&amp;rsquo;s hand. “Thought I&amp;rsquo;d drop in on my way home,” he said. “I&amp;rsquo;ve got something to tell you. How did it go, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I expected it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tore her hat off and threw it down on the first chair in sight. Her hair slanted in a flat curve across her forehead and fell in a straight line to her shoulders; it looked smooth and tight, like a bathing cap of pale, polished metal. She walked to the window and stood looking out over the city. She asked without turning: “What did you want to tell me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvah Scarret watched her pleasurably. He had long since given up any attempts beyond holding her hand when not necessary or patting her shoulder; he had stopped thinking of the subject, but he had a dim, half-conscious feeling which he summed up to himself in the words: You never can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ve got good news for you, child,” he said. “I&amp;rsquo;ve been working out a little scheme, just a bit of reorganization, and I&amp;rsquo;ve figured where I&amp;rsquo;ll consolidate a few things together into a Women&amp;rsquo;s Welfare Department. You know, the schools, the home economics, the care of babies, the juvenile delinquents and all the rest of it&amp;ndash;all to be under one head. And I see no better woman for the job than my little girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you mean me?” she asked, without turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one else but. Just as soon as Gail comes back, I&amp;rsquo;ll get his okay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned and looked at him, her arms crossed, her hands holding her elbows. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Alvah. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean, you don&amp;rsquo;t want it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t want it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake, do you realize what an advance that would be?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Toward what?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never said I was planning a career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be running a dinky back-page column forever!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not forever. Until I get bored with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But think of what you could do in the real game! Think of what Gail could do for you once you come to his attention!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no desire to come to his attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But, Dominique, we need you. The women will be for you solid after tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t think so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why, I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered two columns held for a yarn on the meeting and your speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached for the telephone and handed the receiver to him. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You&amp;rsquo;d better tell them to kill it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She searched through a litter of papers on a desk, found some typewritten sheets and handed them to him. “Here&amp;rsquo;s the speech I made tonight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced through it. He said nothing, but clasped his forehead once. Then he seized the telephone and gave orders to run as brief an account of the meeting as possible, and not to mention the speaker by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right,” said Dominique, when he dropped the receiver. “Am I fired?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shook his head dolefully. “Do you want to be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not necessarily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ll squash the business,” he muttered. “I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it from Gail.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you wish. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Listen, Dominique&amp;ndash;oh I know, I&amp;rsquo;m not to ask any questions&amp;ndash;only why on earth are you always doing things like that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For no reason on earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about that swank dinner where you made certain remarks on this same subject. And then you go and say things like these at a radical meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They&amp;rsquo;re true, though, both sides of it, aren&amp;rsquo;t they?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, sure, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t you have reversed the occasions when you chose to express them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been any point in that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was there any in what you&amp;rsquo;ve done?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No. None at all. But it amused me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can&amp;rsquo;t figure you out, Dominique. You&amp;rsquo;ve done it before. You go along so beautifully, you do brilliant work and just when you&amp;rsquo;re about to make a real step forward&amp;ndash;you spoil it by pulling something like this. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps that is precisely why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will you tell me&amp;ndash;as a friend, because I like you and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in you&amp;ndash;what are you really after?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should think that&amp;rsquo;s obvious. I&amp;rsquo;m after nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled gaily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is there to look so mournful about? I like you, too, Alvah, and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in you. I even like to talk to you, which is better. Now sit still and relax and I&amp;rsquo;ll get you a drink. You need a drink, Alvah.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brought him a frosted glass with ice cubes ringing in the silence. “You&amp;rsquo;re just a nice child, Dominique,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course. That&amp;rsquo;s what I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat down on the edge of a table, her hands flat behind her, leaning back on two straight arms, swinging her legs slowly. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, Alvah, it would be terrible if I had a job I really wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, of all things! Well, of all fool things to say! What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just that. That it would be terrible to have a job I enjoyed and did not want to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I would have to depend on you&amp;ndash;you&amp;rsquo;re a wonderful person, Alvah, but not exactly inspiring and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it would be beautiful to cringe before a whip in your hand&amp;ndash;oh, don&amp;rsquo;t protest, it would be such a polite little whip, and that&amp;rsquo;s what would make it uglier. I would have to depend on our boss Gail&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s a great man, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, only I&amp;rsquo;d just as soon never set eyes on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever gives you such a crazy attitude? When you know that Gail and I would do anything for you, and I personally&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s not only that, Alvah. It&amp;rsquo;s not you alone. If I found a job, a project, an idea or a person I wanted&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;d have to depend on the whole world. Everything has strings leading to everything else. We&amp;rsquo;re all so tied together. We&amp;rsquo;re all in a net, the net is waiting, and we&amp;rsquo;re pushed into it by one single desire. You want a thing and it&amp;rsquo;s precious to you. Do you know who is standing ready to tear it out of your hands? You can&amp;rsquo;t know, it may be so involved and so far away, but someone is ready, and you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of them all. And you cringe and you crawl and you beg and you accept them&amp;ndash;just so they&amp;rsquo;ll let you keep it. And look at whom you come to accept.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I&amp;rsquo;m correct in gathering that you&amp;rsquo;re criticizing mankind in general&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, it&amp;rsquo;s such a peculiar thing&amp;ndash;our idea of mankind in general. We all have a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. But actually all we know of it is the people we meet in our lifetime. Look at them. Do you know any you&amp;rsquo;d feel big and solemn about? There&amp;rsquo;s nothing but housewives haggling at pushcarts, drooling brats who write dirty words on the sidewalks, and drunken debutantes. Or their spiritual equivalent. As a matter of fact, one can feel some respect for people when they suffer. They have a certain dignity. But have you ever looked at them when they&amp;rsquo;re enjoying themselves? That&amp;rsquo;s when you see the truth. Look at those who spend the money they&amp;rsquo;ve slaved for&amp;ndash;at amusement parks and side shows. Look at those who&amp;rsquo;re rich and have the whole world open to them. Observe what they pick out for enjoyment. Watch them in the smarter speak-easies. That&amp;rsquo;s your mankind in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to touch it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But hell! That&amp;rsquo;s not the way to look at it. That&amp;rsquo;s not the whole picture. There&amp;rsquo;s some good in the worst of us. There&amp;rsquo;s always a redeeming feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”So much the worse. Is it an inspiring sight to see a man commit a heroic gesture, and then learn that he goes to vaudeville shows for relaxation? Or see a man who&amp;rsquo;s painted a magnificent canvas&amp;ndash;and learn that he spends his time sleeping with every slut he meets?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you want? Perfection?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&amp;ndash;or nothing. So, you see, I take the nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take the only desire one can really permit oneself. Freedom, Alvah, freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You call that freedom?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What if you found something you wanted?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I won&amp;rsquo;t find it. I won&amp;rsquo;t choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I&amp;rsquo;d have to share it with all the rest of you&amp;ndash;and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You know, I never open again any great book I&amp;rsquo;ve read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can&amp;rsquo;t be shared. Not with people like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique, it&amp;rsquo;s abnormal to feel so strongly about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can feel. Or not at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique, my dear,” he said, with earnest, sincere concern, “I wish I&amp;rsquo;d been your “father. What kind of a tragedy did you have in your childhood?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why, none at all. I had a wonderful childhood. Free and peaceful and not bothered too much by anybody. Well, yes, I did feel bored very often. But I&amp;rsquo;m used to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suppose you&amp;rsquo;re just an unfortunate product of our times. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve always said. We&amp;rsquo;re too cynical, too decadent. If we went back in all humility to the simple virtues&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alvah, how can you start on that stuff? That&amp;rsquo;s only for your editorials and&amp;hellip;” She stopped, seeing his eyes; they looked puzzled and a little hurt. Then she laughed. “I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. You really do believe all that. If it&amp;rsquo;s actually believing, or whatever it is you do that takes its place. Oh, Alvah! That&amp;rsquo;s why I love you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m doing again right now what I did tonight at the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” he asked, bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Talking as I am talking&amp;ndash;to you as you are. It&amp;rsquo;s nice, talking to you about such things. Do you know, Alvah, that primitive people made statues of their gods in man&amp;rsquo;s likeness? Just think of what a statue of you would look like&amp;ndash;of you nude, your stomach and all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now what&amp;rsquo;s that in relation to?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To nothing at all, darling. Forgive me.” She added: “You know, I love statues of naked men. Don&amp;rsquo;t look so silly. I said statues. I had one in particular. It was supposed to be Helios. I got it out of a museum in Europe. I had a terrible time getting it&amp;ndash;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for sale, of course. I think I was in love with it, Alvah. I brought it home with me.”
“Where is it? I&amp;rsquo;d like to see something you like, for a change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Broken? A museum piece? How did that happen?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I broke it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I threw it down the air shaft. There&amp;rsquo;s a concrete floor below.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you totally crazy? Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So that no one else would ever see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She jerked her head, as if to shake off the subject; the straight mass of her hair stirred in a heavy ripple, like a wave through a half-liquid pool of mercury. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, darling. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to shock you. I thought I could speak to you because you&amp;rsquo;re the one person who&amp;rsquo;s impervious to any sort of shock. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. It&amp;rsquo;s no use, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She jumped lightly off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Run on home, Alvah,” she said. “It&amp;rsquo;s getting late. I&amp;rsquo;m tired. See you tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-read the conversation between Dominique Francon and Alvah Scarret in Part I, Chapter XII. Judging by that conversation, why does Dominique choose to destroy the sculpture? Explain your answer using evidence from the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique destroys the statue because she cannot bear to watch the world corrupt what is pure, revealing her inner conflict between her reverence for the ideal and her refusal to be tied to the world. Dominique’s own words corresponding the broken statue was ‘so no one else would see it’. In Dominique’s view, the statue represents purity and everything Dominique wants (her favourite book, a great career, love, etc.). To attain what she wants, embodied by the statute, she acknowledges that she’d ‘have to depend on the whole world’. This creates conflict with her ideals, as she does not want to do so. She states that humans are ‘all so tied together’, ‘all in a net’. To love something is to need it, and needing it means that she would be ensnared in the tight net doomed to compete with others. It means being vulnerable to the world, ultimately accepting the mediocre and the vulgar to protect what she wants, defiling it and herself. Rather than submitting to vulnerability, she affirms to ‘asking nothing. Depend on nothing’ and ‘expect nothing’. By desiring nothing, she believes she can be untangled from the net, thus achieving freedom. Destroying the statue then becomes an act of protection: only in destruction can she shield herself and it from being corrupted. Dominique’s decision to break the statue encapsulates her attitude towards the world: by eliminating everything she loves, she can grant it freedom. This also points to the underlying conflict in her character- her idealism cannot ground its roots in the world because her pessimism worldview stops her from doing so. To ease her pain between her conflicting views, she chooses destruction. In doing so, she honours what she loves by refusing to let it live in a world she deems unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://example.com/p/%E8%87%B4%E6%9C%80%E7%9C%9F%E5%AE%9E%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%B3%E4%B8%BB%E5%86%99%E5%9C%A8%E7%9C%8B%E5%AE%8C%E5%A5%BD%E6%83%B3%E5%81%9A%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E4%B9%8B%E5%90%8E/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;我是一个看完影片就喜欢刷评论的人 。在看完《好想做一次》全四季后，我兴高采烈的去不同网站上翻评论和看点评去了。令我诧异的是，Devi（主角）这个角色的行为/性格包含争议：有些人很喜欢她，又有些人很讨厌她。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这部剧讲述了一位印度裔美国少女Devi在加州的成长故事。她聪明、冲动、情绪丰富，也总是把生活搞得一团糟。这就是主角Devi，一个常常处于崩溃边缘的女孩。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故事从她父亲突然去世的创伤开始，Devi决定在新学年“重塑自己”，走红校园。她的对策是让她和她的朋友Fabiola, Eleanor谈一场校园恋爱。 而在她试图开启恋爱关系时，两个截然不同的男生闯进了她的生活：Paxton，学校里最受欢迎的帅哥，和Ben，她一直以来成绩优异的死对头。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这部剧节奏快，情绪真。每个角色都在成长，试图找到自己，经常搞砸其他人的生活。尤其是Devi：她在愤怒中伤害朋友、在情绪里做错决定，每天想的都是恋爱以及男生；但她也在不断后悔、试着修补的过程中，一点一点地长大。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有些人喜欢她的坦诚，自信；却又有很多人骂她自私自利，网上是否能容忍她做出的行为争议不断。我很喜欢Devi，我欣赏她的坦诚，勇敢与自信。我佩服她在犯下一连串错误后，仍敢承担后果、不觉得羞耻。（如果换作是我，可能早就想逃离地球了谢谢。）我能理解其他人为什么讨厌她：我也不能理解他为什么要因为她喜欢的男生跟Margo大吵一架，也不能理解为什么为了帮她喜欢的男生而抛弃下她处于崩溃边缘的最好的朋友，更不能理解为什么她传播Aneesa 的谣言后想的去道歉的原因是为了让她喜欢的男的回转心意。她的做法并不值得鼓励，甚至违背了我们普遍认同的道德标准。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我并不会为她开脱，但我认为她犯的错误是合理的。她正处于失去父亲的悲痛中和青春期，更何况，这部剧的题材就是成长（Coming of Age story），所以在成长前她必须要犯错，因为只有犯下错误，才从中反思才能成长。
Coming of age story 应该是什么样子的呢？对于这个的解释，谷歌说“Coming of age deals with the process of transitioning from childhood to adulthood. Stories in this genre typically follow a young protagonist&amp;rsquo;s journey to maturation.”这个的大致意思就是：成长题材的故事通常围绕着主角从幼年迈向成年展开，记录他们逐渐走向成熟的经历。很多著作，名片比如《怦然心动》，《伯德小姐》，《杀死一只知更鸟》都是与成长相关的。主角与Devi相似，他们对于未来充满迷茫与不确定，在不同的方面（亲情，爱情，善恶等）探索， 挣扎，不断犯错，反思后并成长。这些主角如同千千万万个我们，在他们自己平凡的生活中探索，反思，并随之获得成长，逐渐成熟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前一二季的Devi十分莽撞，脚踏两条船，恶意造谣，跟踪她妈妈约会，但我感觉后两季，尤其是最后几集真的能看出来她的成长与蜕变。这部剧情的确有夸大事实，但我认为是一个非常值得一看的剧。Devi是勇敢的，真实的；她不是个完美的角色，但正因为如此，她更像我们大多数人青春期的样子。她把我们在现实中不敢说、不敢做的混乱、挣扎与情绪，放上了屏幕。
成长没有正确答案，但愿我们都能像Devi一样，即使跌跌撞撞，也不放弃成为更完整的自己。&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;摘要&#34;&gt;摘要
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;本文基于结构主义与黑格尔辩证法的理论，分析了电影《瞬息全宇宙》中伊芙琳与女儿乔伊关系的变化，旨在回答“女主角和女儿的关系为何突然发生巨大转变”这一问题。我们的研究表明母女冲突的根源在于象征秩序对真实界符号化的必然失败。具体而言，面对秩序崩溃，伊芙琳的初期应对策略是借助“幻想”并通过“增强能指在能指链上滑动”来压制剩余。但符号化的过程必然生产新的剩余，过度的符号化最终会导致“主体死亡”。伊芙琳的转变在于：她放弃了对“剩余”（失控的女儿乔伊）的暴力镇压企图，直接面对这个“剩余”，进而转向了“容纳”与“共生”。从历时性的角度而言，这真正的本质是辩证法所提供的运动性：正题与反题的矛盾冲突，最终必然运动出了一个能容纳矛盾的合题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关键词：剩余，象征秩序，结构主义，辩证法，《瞬息全宇宙》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;引言&#34;&gt;引言
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;电影《瞬息全宇宙》开篇呈现了华裔移民伊芙琳及其家庭在美国面临的重重生存压力。伊芙琳经营着一家濒临倒闭的洗衣店，她时常陷入税务纠纷和家庭关系的困境。她的现实生活正经历着多重结构性崩溃：洗衣店经营濒临破产边缘；女儿Joy的成长轨迹与她的设想严重偏离，丈夫韦蒙不仅表现怯懦，更在此时意图提出离婚；她的父亲对伊芙琳施加着无形的控制。在此情景下，伊芙琳与家庭成员的关系普遍紧张，尤其与女儿Joy之间的冲突尤为尖锐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一场景中，伊芙琳与她的父亲和韦蒙一起去税务局查账。进入电梯的后，韦蒙突然摘下眼镜，性格瞬间转变。他变成了与现实相反，果敢，强势，控制欲强的韦蒙，以命令式口吻和伊芙琳说“别多问！”和“我来！”。
韦蒙告诉伊芙琳，他们最大的敌人是多重宇宙中的“大魔王”乔布·图帕基，一个拥有无穷的力量和知识，是全能的存在，与现实中无能，被视为“失败者”的女儿相反。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;转变到第二场景后，伊芙琳在韦蒙的带领下不断变强，在不同的宇宙中穿梭，习得越来越多的技能来打败不同的敌人。然而，随着伊芙琳能力的增强，她发现她的女儿也随之变得更强，她始终无法战胜。无论她穿越到哪一个宇宙，她的女儿都会跟过来追杀她。在其中一个宇宙中，Joy向伊芙琳揭示了她最终的目的——她渴望母亲能与她看到“相同之物”，也就是凝聚了她所有能看到的东西的贝果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在第三场景，在她与乔布·图帕基战斗时，她的身体不堪重负，呕吐后突然倒下死亡了。接着画面便开始切换，伊芙琳在多重宇宙中迅速切换。在成为大明星的伊芙琳的宇宙中，韦蒙向伊芙琳阐述了自己的生存之道，也就是“be kind”。这给伊芙琳提供了一种新的对抗方和相处方式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在后续的对抗中，她不再渴望武力压制，而是让步、满足对方的需求。例如，面对一位渴望治愈脊椎损伤的保安，伊芙琳在交锋过程中为其正骨，消除了他的痛苦并为其带来满足感，从而化解了他的攻击欲望。伊芙琳也减少了对女儿的控制欲。这一点集中体现在她们都化身为石头的宇宙中：她安静地聆听女儿的心声，充分尊重女儿乔伊的想法。当女儿跳下悬崖时，她并未阻拦，而是尊重其选择，并随她一同跃下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳学会了包容与让步之后，回到现实中，对自己的女儿袒露了心声，同时也真的开始倾听自己女儿说的话。她对自己的女儿表示理解，但也有约法三章。后来在这个家庭中，伊芙琳对家人表达了更多的理解，进而修复了家庭关系。最终税务困境也得到了解决。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;问题提出&#34;&gt;问题提出
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;基于以上的叙述脉络，本文旨在解答核心问题：“伊芙琳和女儿的关系为什么会突然发生那么大的转变？”我们将该问题分解为3个子问题：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景一中，伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是相反的？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景二中，为什么伊芙琳越强，女儿和贝果也越强？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景三中，伊芙琳的心态是如何发生变化的？为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;电影分析&#34;&gt;电影分析
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题1在场景一中伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系&#34;&gt;问题1：在场景一中，伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想&#34;&gt;伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;在第一场景中，伊芙琳突然见到性格大变的韦蒙，并非偶然，而是她在面对分崩离析的生活时感到崩溃，从而产生的幻想，用幻想来弥补自己的崩溃。她经营的洗衣店濒临破产，与女儿的关系紧张，丈夫也表现得软弱无力，这对伊芙琳来说是一种剩余（surplus）暴露。这一剩余指的是现实（象征界）中无法被符号整合、不被语言命名的部分，它暴露出秩序的不完整和无法掌控之处。于是，伊芙琳用幻想填补了剩余的缺口。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系&#34;&gt;为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;在这个想象界中，韦蒙的原有性格——软弱、胆小，突然变成了“果断”“强势”的新性格，韦蒙就是伊芙琳幻想出来的另一种可能性。这种性格变化显示了幻想的支撑作用：她希望韦蒙成为一个能掌控局势、带她逃离混乱现实的人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;韦蒙所说的“最大敌人”乔布·图帕基，是对现实中Joy的极端想象化处理。现实中，Joy的离经叛道令伊芙琳失望，她无法直接接受女儿的真实状态，于是Joy被转化为一个“全知全能”的形象。这种想象中的乔布·图帕基代表着一个无法被象征系统完全容纳的“剩余”——也就是Joy身上那些超出伊芙琳理解和控制范围的部分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总之，那些突然变化的角色形象由伊芙琳的幻想产生，这种幻想是精神的补丁。用来处理现实中象征秩序功能无法完全整合主体经验后产生的剩余。第一场景中的幻想从结构上揭示了家庭关系中的裂缝，也着重显示了母女关系中的裂缝之大。这同时也是埋下了后续关系修复与缓和的种子。只有真正面对乔布·图帕基，伊芙琳才有可能真正承认、理解那个复杂、离经叛道的女儿Joy。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题2在场景二中为什么伊芙琳越强女儿和贝果也越强&#34;&gt;问题2：在场景二中，为什么伊芙琳越强，女儿和贝果也越强？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;当伊芙琳在不同宇宙穿梭，学习她们的技能时，她的能指也在不断的叠加。当她穿梭到每一个宇宙中，这些能指重叠链接，形成了一条越来越长，不断滑动的能指链。能指链的形成并不能够产生意义，不稳定，而是永远处于滑动之中。她在变强，但‘变强’的方式是通过不断吸收能指，更快地滑动能指链，不断地增强她的象征秩序。这种不停滑动的能指反倒揭示了她无法在象征秩序中派指出自己的稳定位置，她只不过是将无数个能指拼接在一起，试图用此方法来防止自己面对真实界。但每当她跳到新的宇宙中（更换能指），她并不能完全符号化真实界，但却产生了新的剩余。所以，每一次的转变能指都会产生新的剩余。而她女儿的贝果就恰好代表了剩余，指向的是真实界，无法言说之物。伊芙琳每一次的攻击建立在象征界上，是希望通过增强象征秩序而去制约剩余，但剩余无法被囊括在象征界内，它在结构上无法被表达。贝果和女儿处在的这种结构性的位置上否定了伊芙琳依赖能指增强自己的实力的方式，使伊芙琳无法战胜她的女儿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题3在场景三中为什么伊芙琳死亡了为什么被打败后才寻求改变伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化如何发生的&#34;&gt;问题3：在场景三中，为什么伊芙琳死亡了？为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化？如何发生的？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么伊芙琳死亡了&#34;&gt;为什么伊芙琳死亡了？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;随着伊芙琳在多重宇宙中不断用暴力的方式击败（镇压）对手（是秩序化的体现），当她进入场景三直面女儿乔伊（乔布·图帕基）（也就是剩余本身）时，突然呕吐并随即倒地“死亡”。这里的“呕吐”正是身体对“真实界”的入侵——即主体被迫直接遭遇那创伤性的、无法被符号化的“剩余”（the leftover）——所做出的最直接、最原始的反应。 伊芙琳此前通过不断学习并叠加多重宇宙的技能，本质上是持续加强原先的“能指”（signifiers），试图以此增加伊芙琳的控制能力，即增强象征界应对和管理混乱表象的能力。然而，这种能指增加恰恰意味着“符号化过程”（symbolization）的不断加强，也即象征界疆域的不断膨胀。 伊芙琳的“死亡”，其核心原因在于：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;主体结构最终无法承受过度的能指，最终发生了崩溃。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;每一次符号化行为（获取新技能），虽然在象征界内部看似增强了秩序，但都必然产生无法被消化的创伤性“剩余”。伊芙琳每一次通过符号化来压制混乱，实则是在持续积累这些产生出来的剩余。当她最终直面女儿（即剩余本身的化身）时，这些被压抑的剩余最终以最猛烈的方式进行了反扑。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;正如拉康所言，“象征符正是对事物的谋杀”（“The symbol manifests itself first of all as the murder of the thing”） （埃文斯，1996，p.61）。象征界作为符号化秩序，其运作本身就意味着对主体的动态性的抹杀。伊芙琳试图通过无限扩大象征界（获取更多能指）来解决问题（也就是不断增强自己的主导能指，恰恰使其主体深陷于符号秩序的牢笼之中，丧失了动态性，最终导致了主体性“死亡”——这正是过度象征化的必然恶果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么被打败后才寻求改变&#34;&gt;为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;当在场景三的“死亡”后，伊芙琳开始采取新的与人相处的方式，也就是从强势的控制，让步给对方留出了更多的空间。在“死亡”之前，伊芙琳的策略始终是通过不断强化既有能指的强度（也就是不断学习多重宇宙中的各种技能），试图增强自己的控制力来 “管理”混乱。然而，最后的“死亡”作为了一个转折点。 正是这里的“死亡”，伊芙琳才真正开始承认了自己的主体是有裂缝的主体，直接面对了自己的创伤——她对女儿，对生意的无能为力。唯有在直接面对剩余之后，她才需要使用新的能指（signifiers）（如“留出空间”），以此尝试重构其崩解的主体性，并重新建立合适的秩序。这一重构目的，是试图（暂时地）延宕（defer）真实界剩余的反扑，稳定主体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化如何发生变化的&#34;&gt;伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化？如何发生变化的？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳的心态及其和他人的互动模式发生了根本性蜕变：她摒弃了依赖武力压制（一种暴力的秩序化）的旧有方式，转而采用以退让满足对方需求的新方式；对待女儿也从强制性的控制转向了倾听与陪伴。这一深刻的心态转变，核心原因在于她承认了自己的主体是有裂缝的主体、直面了创伤，认识了剩余。她旧的能指系统（以暴力控制为核心）已经不够用了，由此她主动开始寻求改变。伊芙琳从她丈夫那吸收了“Be Kind（以善意方式对待他人）”这个能指，使自己的能指库发生了变化。然而，伊芙琳并没有简单的直接接受能指：她将丈夫的“善意”（Kindness）能指与自身的旧能指（暴力镇压）进行了重组，最终构建出一个全新的能指。这一新能指比旧能指更柔和（体现“善意”的接纳与非暴力），但依然保留了控制的意图——其控制方式从显性的暴力镇压转化为对方接受或喜欢的更加隐性的控制方式，形成了一种“以善意为名的引导”。电影中也对此提供了有力佐证：在“正骨”情节中，表面是满足需求的服务行为（体现善意），实则暗含对身体的强力矫正与掌控（保留的控制性），展现了 “以服务之名行控制之实”的本质；而在“石头宇宙”场景中，超越语言的静默陪伴，恰恰成为有效阻止女儿坠入虚无（实现终极控制目标） 的最有力手段。因此，伊芙琳的心态变化，本质上是在符号性死亡的废墟上，通过融合新旧能指（“善意”与“控制”），形成了全新的更为温和的（承认剩余的）能指，让家庭变得更和谐，也让整个家庭的能指链重新开始滑动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;结论&#34;&gt;结论
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;汇总&#34;&gt;汇总
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;母女关系的巨大转变，并非源于伊芙琳在力量上“战胜”了女儿，而是源于她经历了象征秩序的崩溃（死亡）后，放弃了对“剩余”（女儿）的暴力镇压企图，转向了“容纳”与“共生”。她不再试图消除女儿的不可控性和虚无感（贝果），而是学会了在承认并接纳这些“剩余”的前提下，运用融合了善意与引导的新策略（温和霸权）来重建连接与秩序。这种转变的核心是：从“消除裂缝”到“与裂缝共存”，从“控制”到“陪伴与倾听”。这最终修复了现实中的母女关系，并化解了其他现实困境（如税务问题），象征着新的、更具包容性的主体性和家庭秩序的重建。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;讨论&#34;&gt;讨论
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;齐泽克认为黑格尔的想法是：“辩证法远非有关逐步克服（progressive overcoming）的故事，而是对如此努力之失败所作的系统注释—“绝对知识”（absolute knowledge）指的是这样一种主体立场，它最终接受了“矛盾”，并把矛盾视为每个同一性（every identity）的内在条件。” 根据黑格尔所述，绝对知识是一种对于认知结构本身就存在悖论的认识和接受，是自我和现实中达成调和的认知状态。但这种状态不是固定的，而是运动的。本文同时讨论到了黑格尔的辩证法，并将此的应用将限于正题，反题和合题。正题(Thesis)，及发展的起点，是某种观点，存在或状态。反题(Antithesis)，即对立面的显现，是对于正题的否定。合题(Synthesis)，即对立面的统一，包含了正题与反题，并将其中的矛盾克服。任何命题都是有漏洞的，有对立面（及反题）。正题和反题是主体和剩余之间的关系，被主体连在一起，无法拆开（运动性）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如，一个人“希望自己能变得更好，希望能更自律” （正题）；但他在“成为更好的自己”的过程中常常受到想刷视频，放空，聊天的困扰，这使他开始想‘我正在做的这些事情无法使我变得更好’ （反题）,否定了他对自己‘变得更好’的定义。他感受到两者之间的冲突后，有一天终于承认 ”我对变好的渴望和对想刷视频，想放空休息的渴望同时存在。“在面对两者之间的冲突中，他并不再希望判断或克服对错，而是接受了二者之间的矛盾，认识到了正是这种矛盾构成了他自己。但这在不断运动——他对“更好”的定义可能在不断的改变，在休息与努力中来回摇摆。他后续意识到这种问题，并且认识到‘我’在‘变好’的冲动中也存在着失败和偷懒，但‘我’仍然在冲突中前行。他在二者的矛盾之间前行，在知道自己会摇摆的前提下偶尔会选择去刷视频，偶尔会愿意早起背单词。合题并不是在正题与反题中找到中间值，而是在冲突与矛盾中演变，上升与创新。但这在不断运动——他对“更好”的定义可能在不断的改变，在休息与努力中来回摇摆。他在二者的矛盾之间前行，在知道自己会摇摆的前提下偶尔会选择去刷视频，偶尔会愿意早起背单词。他的这种行为形成了新的合题；在认识到并接受不断运动的矛盾，也便是黑格尔所说的绝对知识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳最开始在面对她崩溃的象征界的方式是通过不断的滑动能指，不接受真实界中暴露出来的剩余（正题），而她的女儿（反题）代表着剩余，属于真实界的。当伊芙琳经历过死亡后并且吸收了她老公的能指，她开始面对剩余，而且不再执着于通过符号化去面对真实界。她认识并接受了正题与反题之间的冲突，向绝对知识靠拢。对于绝对知识的把握利于她更好地运动，形成合题。她后续选择了使用她的方法，在跟女儿吵架后学会了让步，但同时也表达出了她自己的诉求，在面对正题和反题中开辟出了新的道路（合题）。伊芙琳在与女儿斗争时就是正题与反题的运动和发展，在过程中不停的尝试，自然生出了新的合题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;研究启示&#34;&gt;研究启示
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;对于《瞬息全宇宙》的分析，也为我们理解现实生活中的母女关系与个体自我发展提供了深刻的启示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在家庭关系中，子女的选择偶尔会与家长所规划的道路冲突。如果父母强行左右子女的兴趣想法（即进行“符号化”），而非直接面对双方存在的差异，矛盾和冲突只会加剧，导致更严重的负面后果。父母应该认识到彼此之间选择的差异，并与子女共同面对。但这里并不意味着父母需要完全接纳子女的想法，也不意味着子女要必须服从父母的想法，而是认识到双方想法间的冲突。比如当母亲对女儿选择专业的道路感到不满时，母亲应该意识到女儿对自己专业的抉择与自己期望女儿选择的专业是冲突的。随着双方在逐渐深入地认识彼此的想法后，解决二者之间的冲突的方式就可以不是任意一方去迁就另一方，而是可以在冲突之间开辟出新的道路，达成一种动态平衡。比如母亲可以尝试了解女儿所选专业的价值与发展前景，女儿也可以倾听母亲的担忧与经验；双方通过深入沟通可能会发现，可以在主修专业之外辅修相关课程，或者寻找两个领域的交叉方向，在尊重彼此立场的基础上找到更具创新性的解决方案。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人与人的关系并非追求无冲突的乌托邦，而是在于建立将冲突转化为成长动力的机制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;拉康将一个“能指”（英：signifier；法：signifiant）定义为“为另一能指代表一个主体的东西”。例如“爱”这个字或其发音“ai”是一个“能指”，当我们说出“我爱你”这句话时，我们就使用了这个能指，它试图去指向某种情感或关系状态，也就是我们通常称之为“爱”的“所指”（英：signified；法：signifié）。然而，这个所指并非一个固定、明确的情感实体本身。相反，它在一个能指链中滑动。如，“爱”可能与“欲望”、“忠诚”、“痛苦”、“缺失”等能指相关联，其具体意义依赖于语境和其他能指。能指是凭借自己与该系统内其他能指之间的差异来呈现其自身价值的，也就是说能指a之所以时是能指a，是因为能指a不是能指b也不是能指c。所以能指永远都无法具有某种单一或固定的意义。比如说，对于厌学的学生来说，自由就是不上学。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;所指（英：signified；法：signifié）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉康认为“所指”是“能指”的一种效果，是经由隐喻而产生的意指过程的一种效果。也就是说“所指”不是给定的，而是生成的。比如说，“狗”这个词或者发音是一个“能指”。当我们听到“狗”这个词时，它并不直接、固定地指向某个单一的、明确的“狗的概念”。不同的人、不同的语境下，这个词引发的想法、情感、联想（即所指）是完全不同的。在情景A中：有人会说：“看，有一只可爱的狗。” 这里的所指（也就是具体的动物）是在“狗”与“猫”、“鸟”等其他动物能指的差异中相对确立的，不同人想到的具体狗的形象也不同（例如，金毛 贵宾犬）。在情景B中， 有人说：“他真是个忠实的朋友，像条狗一样。” 这里，“狗”这个“能指”隐喻性地替代了“极度忠诚”这个“能指”。所指效果变成了“绝对的忠诚”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;能指链（英：Signifying chain 法：chaîne signifiante）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;能指链条指的就是相互关联的能指构成的序列，是永无止尽的。当一个人说：“我梦到森林&amp;hellip;” 时，森林是第一个能指。它本身有很多含义，但具体指向什么还不明确。当他后面他接着说：“&amp;hellip;那森林很黑暗&amp;hellip;”，“黑暗” 是第二个能指，链接到了第一个能指，限定“森林”的性质。随后，他又说，”我感到特别的孤独…”，“孤独” 是第三个能指，进一步指定了他在黑暗森林中的感受。现在，“森林-黑暗-孤独”形成了一个能指链条。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;剩余（英：surplus 法：plus）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;指符号化（用语言表达）过程中不可避免产生的超出部分，是一种溢出，它总在意义之外、抵抗被完全表达；同时也是象征秩序中固有的结构性裂隙，属于真实界的部分。
它就好比整理行李箱时放进太多衣物，我们试图强行拉上拉链，但是始终有一部分会卡住拉链，让拉链无法被完全拉上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;象征界（英：Symbolic，法：symbolique）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;象征界（英：Symbolic，法：symbolique）是结构化的。是语言、法律、社会规范、文化的领域，是“名字之父”统治下的秩序系统，本质上是一个语言的维度。象征界是一说话就被迫加入的、管理着我们生活方方面面的社会规则系统，加入它让我们成为社会人，但也让我们戴上了“语言”和“规则”的面具，无法再完全“做自己”（直接表达原始欲望）。比如说，象征界就像是一个巨大的、无形的“规则网”或“游戏规则手册”。 这个“规则网”不是物理存在的，但它像空气一样无处不在，深刻地影响着我们如何生活、如何理解自己和世界。用更具体的例子来说：刚出生的婴儿饿了，会直接哇哇大哭；看到妈妈，会咿咿呀呀伸手要抱。这是最直接的欲望表达，这时还没有进入语言。接着，他妈妈开始教他：“这是‘妈妈’”，“这是‘奶瓶’”，“‘饿’了要说‘饿’”。宝宝学会了用“妈妈”这个符号代表那个特定的人，用“饿”这个词代表肚子不舒服的感觉，用“奶瓶”代表那个能解除饥饿的物体。 这时就进入了象征界，他不再只是用哭喊这种原始方式表达饥饿，必须通过“饿”这个词来代表他的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;想象界（英：Imaginary，法：imaginaire）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想象界（英：Imaginary，法：imaginaire）是幻象、形象与空想、欺骗与诱骗的领域。是整体性、综合性、自主性。是具有欺骗性，有可观察的现象的领域。想象界就类似于照哈哈镜。镜子里那个被拉长、压扁或扭曲的形象，就是幻象。当我们凝视镜中那个看似完整统一的人形，瞬间会产生一种“那就是我”的强烈认同感——这就是想象界的欺骗性与诱骗性。它用一个外在的、虚幻的视觉形象，诱使我们误认为 这个扭曲的、看似自主可控的镜像就是我们真实、完整的自己。当象征界无法完全符号化实在界的时候，想象界就会出现暂时弥补。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;实在界（英：real, 法：réel）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实在界（英：real, 法：réel）指的是不可言说，无法被象征的事物。他独立于人类建构的符号，是永远无法被象征化的剩余部分。当言语无法解释某物，真实界就会显露来，以焦虑、创伤或荒谬的形式出现。实在界就好比小时候听到父母吵架时候的冲击，那是一种无法用语言表达出来的冲击，改变了他原本对家庭结构的看法。这种东西无法被整合入象征界，小孩子的已有认知，而是存在于象征之外，无法被覆盖或描述。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;死亡（英：death；法：mort）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是象征秩序的构成性要素，象征符（symbol）代替了它所象征的事物，从而便等同于那一事物的死亡，正如同拉康所述，“象征符是对于事物的谋杀”。比如，当一个人被取名“张三”后，每次叫“张三”，是在叫这个符号而不是这个人，这个人就被“张三”这个符号代替了，动态的，变化的一个人就被符号固定住了，被叫“张三”的这个人就受到了象征符的谋杀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;能指宝库（英：battery of signifiers 法：)：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;能指宝库是在象征秩序中已经存在的能指集合。它是象征系统中语言，文化，社会规范等的储备库。能指宝库具有权威性，因为主体必须通过能指宝库中的能指指派自己的身份；它还具有匮乏性，因为能指宝库中的所有能指无法完全符号化真实界。能指宝库好比与于给婴儿取名时的命名系统，涵盖着里面的姓氏，汉字，和文化规则等；但这个名字永远无法彻底代表主体本身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;焦虑（英：anxiety 法： angoisse）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是一种我们无法定位无法摆脱的强烈不安感。它不是对某个具体丧失某个东西的反应，而是在我们无法确认失去的是什么，甚至不确定是否真的失去了什么时产生的不适。它可能发生在某个熟悉的事物突然变得陌生、熟悉的关系突然中断、或者我们不知道自己在别人眼中意味着什么的时候。就像一个人在不透明的奶茶杯里吸不到东西，不知道原因为何。只是，他无法用奶茶喝完了，或者吸管坏了来解释。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;滑动（英：slip 法：glisser【动词】，glissement【名词】）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉康使用动词“滑动”(slip)(及其相应的名词“滑移”[slippage])来描述能指与所指之间的不稳定关系。例如，“狗”这个词，就是一个能指，它就像一个飘在水面上的标签。你第一次学它时，它可能稳稳贴在你家金毛犬身上。但很快你发现，邻居的哈士奇、小巧的吉娃娃也叫“狗”；甚至有人形容独身的朋友为“单身狗”，抱怨“累成狗”，或者骂人时说“狗东西”。这时你会发现，“狗”这个标签根本无法固定在一个单个的东西上——它在不同的场合滑动着、漂移着，指向宠物、品种、比喻人、比喻状态甚至辱骂。词语（能指）和它想表达的具体意思（所指）之间，并没有天生锁死的链条，而是在语境中不断滑动。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>黑塞笔下的女人，都活在男人的梦里？</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/%E9%BB%91%E5%A1%9E%E7%AC%94%E4%B8%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%B3%E4%BA%BA%E9%83%BD%E6%B4%BB%E5%9C%A8%E7%94%B7%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%A2%A6%E9%87%8C/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/%E9%BB%91%E5%A1%9E%E7%AC%94%E4%B8%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%B3%E4%BA%BA%E9%83%BD%E6%B4%BB%E5%9C%A8%E7%94%B7%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%A2%A6%E9%87%8C/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;黑塞一直是我最喜欢的一位作家之一。他的语言优美，字句之间透露出沉思者的气质。而且，他几乎所有的作品都围绕着“自我”这一主题展开——一个我始终感兴趣，也始终在思索的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我很喜欢看不同人对同一本书，作家的讨论，所以在上网时，我经常会看到一些探讨黑塞书中女性的评论。有些人认为黑塞在探寻自我的过程中并没有摆脱性别观念的局限，在读他笔下的女性角色的过程中会感到不适。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不得不承认，有时，我对此也深感不适。比如，《克林索尔的最后夏天》中，黑塞描述道“但所有女子都爱他，都希望被他爱恋。于是女子间爆发了战火，红发女用敏捷的手抓扯黑发女的头发，把她拉扯到地上，自己也倒地了。女人们互相推搡，每位都在叫、撕、咬，每位都在伤人和被人伤害，大笑、怒吼与痛号相互缠绕，相互纠结，血流得到处都是，丰满肉身被残酷撞击。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读到这段后，我就没再看下去了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我开始思考：为什么一个在精神层面如此细腻敏感的作家，却在描写女性时让人感到如此陌生？这些女性角色，究竟属于文学的真实，还是只是男人梦中的倒影？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是，我开始梳理黑塞作品中的一些女性角色。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;黑塞笔下有一些伟大而光辉的女性形象，比如《德米安》中的艾娃夫人。但&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;她们让我感到陌生，仿佛脱离了‘人’的范畴。回到我刚刚描述的艾娃夫人，她在辛克莱（主角）眼中像 “散发着母性的光辉、严厉以及激情。她美丽迷人、无可匹敌”。对于辛克莱的想法，梦中的思考，她会倾听并给出建议，她既是他母亲般的引导者，也是他欲望的投射对象，带有某种神性的梦幻色彩。在悉达多眼中，卡玛拉是悉达多人生的‘世俗阶段’，她教会他了情欲，爱情。她聪慧，美丽，但她在完成任务后就离开，让悉达多继续前行。《在轮下》里，艾玛也如同汉斯的‘老师’，她给他带来了爱恋的愉悦，也让他体会到了被背叛的心痛感。
她们仿佛只是工具，为主角带来了启发与成长的契机，却本身十分扁平。她们似乎只能给主角带来男女关系方面的见解，或者如同母亲般给他们带来温暖的怀抱。我感到不适，是因为我无法体会到她们成长时的挣扎，痛苦，我看不到卡马拉的探索与自我的发现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是，我在喜欢与质疑之间反复徘徊。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同时，我们也可以说黑塞并没有考虑到当代的男女性观念。比如，在《德米安》中，辛克莱说过，他认为艾娃夫人是 “有时，我觉得吸引我的并非她本人，而是我内心中的一个意象，其唯一目的就是引领我探究内心深处。她说的话很多时候都像是我潜意识中那些问题的答复。”对于《荒原狼》中，赫米娜像是另一个性别的主角，他们有着相似的灵魂，相似的想法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;她能够走入我的思想，而思想也能幻化成她。  ——《德米安》165页&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这让我想到了荣格中的‘Anima’概念。这是男性潜意识中呈现出来的女性形象，像是男性中‘阴性’的部分。荣格认为，如果男性想达成完整的自我，他们就必须去面对，整合，并理解他的Amina。从这个角度去看，我倒觉得黑塞书中的所有女性几乎都符合。她们是帮助他成长的工具，她们是主角心目中理想的女性形象，是引领主角去探索自我的导师，也像是诱惑者，是自我成长道路上的绊脚石。但这些形象都是黑塞的投射，是黑塞的一部分，而并非我们认识到的传统意义上的女性。如果黑塞写的始终是他自身的自我探索与表达，那我们是否可以推断：我们不必拘泥于性别视角的缺失，因为书中所有的角色、尤其是女性角色，都是他内在自我的投射，他描述的仅是自我的发现和成长呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我觉得是可以这么理解的。作为读者，我们的目的也许并不是去拿性别的尺度去衡量这本书到底好不好，因为这只是黑塞对自我的表达。但这并不妨碍我在阅读过程中感到不适，因为部分描述让女性读者难以在其中产生共鸣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于黑塞的书，我更希望能在理解与批判之间找到一种平衡。我不需要不读黑塞的作品，但也不需要强迫自己接受他对女性的描绘就是“合理的”。我们可以既欣赏他文字中的深刻，又意识到这种深刻是以某些沉默为代价建立起来的。毕竟文学作品不是终点，而是对话的起点。对于黑塞的书籍的讨论反倒能更好让我们形成自己的观点。&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/%E5%9C%A8%E8%BD%AE%E4%B8%8B/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;最开始读过黑塞的德米安，感觉很有意思，又开始读起了他的荒原狼。感觉有点难，所以我又回到了他写的比较容易的书，在轮下中。 在表达我的感受前，我还是想先说一下黑塞。我很喜欢黑塞的书，虽然读完需要反复品味，但他的文笔优美，他的想法也很令人深思。我读了两遍德米安，和读完在轮下后一样，感觉每次都多少会有一些新的感悟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在轮下并不是一篇很长的小说，我大概断断续续地花了3个小时不到读完了这本书。黑塞主要围绕了一个少年，汉斯，和他在他的家乡，神学院中发生的事情。汉斯在学习过程中结识了叛逆的赫尔曼，在过程中逐渐抑郁，回到了家乡。汉斯像是一个天才，他努力，上进，在州试中以优越的第二名的成绩考进了神学院。在神学院初期，他很孤独，经常一个人。他认识到了很多人，其中之一就是赫尔曼。他热烈，感性，渴望自由，并看不起汉斯这种一生好好学习，费心费力，最后为政府做牛做马的生活。再一次既然巧合下，他们成为了朋友。他们之间经历过磨合，但与赫尔曼的友谊让汉斯感到甘之如饴，并为此放弃了学业。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在我看来，赫尔曼和汉斯的友谊既奇怪又新奇。赫尔曼学习好，经常会找汉斯去聊天，而汉斯虽然喜欢听他讲话，但这严重的干扰到了他的学习。从此，他的学业一落千丈，在学院中和赫尔曼收到了鄙视。最后，赫尔曼受不了压抑的氛围，逃出了，奔向了自由，只留下了汉斯一个人受着嘲笑和鄙视。所以，我很好奇，赫尔曼到底给汉斯带来了什么？是孤独一人的绝望，身患抑郁症还是备受启发的思想，增进了对自我的探索？我觉得都有。赫尔曼的悄无声息逃离总会让我想起被朋友抛弃的感受-郁闷。老师学生对汉斯的嘲弄，排挤，更深刻的加重了他的病症，使得他最后只好退学。用这些悲痛换取对自我的探索，我实在不清楚是否是值当的。但从赫尔曼那里，我感觉汉斯体会到了自由，美，和一种情愫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最深有感触的还是黑塞在书中提到的死亡。当汉斯得了抑郁症，被送回家时，他麻木不仁，有一段时间想过寻死。汉斯从他对死亡的计划中得到了快感，尤其有一句“想着父亲开心的原因竟是他不久以后的死亡”，他带着讽刺的快感想着。有时候很抑郁，崩溃的时候想过说以死去寻求/换取注意，其他人的一种悔恨，在我看来，是一件非常愚蠢的事情（但是我感觉这种想法对我来说挺常见的）。书中，汉斯在神学院中也见证过死亡-有一些青年处于青春期的烦恼，找出了一种快捷的道路去结束这一切-自杀。死亡是一件很沉重的话题，但是赴死太容易了。轻轻一扣动板机，落入河中，海中，或者向地面飞去，一个活生生的生命就消失了。汉斯的另一个朋友，赫尔曼，身患疾病，在与汉斯玩的时候，有一天就悄悄离去了。死亡很突然，有时甚至很平静。最后，汉斯与月亮一同沉入河中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到了结局，我感觉到了一种无力感。汉斯备受压迫，从小就被要求好好学习，考上神学院；到了神学院之后又被要求好好学习，以后为政府服务。赫尔曼将他从这种日复一日，滚滚向前的人生中解救了出来，但这给汉斯带来了很复杂的感情，想法。他无法，或者不清楚如何去逃离生活的巨轮，所以就只能被轮子压着，压到抑郁症，碾压直至喘不上气，静静的死去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但从另一方面想，或许死亡也是一种解脱？是从一望不到头，日复一日的单调的生活中的解脱；是从滚滚向前轮子下向外跑出了，获得了难得的自由与幸福。&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;这本书讲述了主人公，杨飞死后的几天的经历。他的灵魂似乎没死，因为在死后他立马就被叫去火化了。在要火化的这几天中，他遇到了他的前妻，李青，朋友，鼠妹，和他的父亲。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我认为这本书是比较值得一看的，因为他给了我们对于死亡的全新看法。余华书中的事件反映了他出版这本书近几年的新闻。读完我真的感到了深深的讽刺，也不禁悲叹于部分人民的经历（真是麻绳专挑细处断），真是苦了一生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当杨飞死后，他因没钱没有办法买墓，没办法被安葬。他向前走去，开始回忆起了他的一生。他想起了他与李青的婚姻（我个人不太喜欢这一部分，感觉很写的仓促，结婚理由，离婚理由也很离谱-可能是我不懂爱情吧），想起了他与他的家人（他的父亲，将他视为自己孩子的“母亲”。我认为这一部分写的很好，非常的感人-杨飞不是亲生的，是捡的，但杨金彪-他的父亲-对他不离不弃。他为他拒绝了爱情，虽然在杨飞四岁时抛弃了他，但后面的那句话“爸爸你来了，你终于来了”真的令人落泪）。在路上，他终于走到了死无葬身之地。那里绿草如茵，树木郁郁葱葱，有些人成为了白骨，有些人的肉开始腐烂，但所有人都很快乐。他遇到的张警官和李先生正在下棋（他们一个本是罪犯另一个是逮捕的人员，但在这里成为了朋友。我估计他的作用是衬托出死无葬身之地的美妙之处，乌托邦的感觉，但我个人感觉这个转变太离谱了，太不符合逻辑了-原本发誓要杀死对方的仇人突然成了朋友），他遇到了他的干妈，他遇到了鼠妹（我跟人感觉这个部分写的很有感触。鼠妹和他的男朋友很贫穷，但很相爱。事发原因是因为鼠妹想要iphone 6，但发现他男朋友给她买的是盗版的。她试着联系他却没联系上，便伤心欲绝，欲要跳楼。在救她时，她不慎滑倒，摔落。当他的男朋友得知后，他卖肾给她买了一个墓，却因失血过多而死亡。)我最喜欢的描述是当所有人得知鼠妹有了墓后，每个人排着队，捧着水将她清洗干净，给她做寿衣，将她送走。这将死无葬身之地衬托成了无虑无忧的乌托邦，充满美好的意味。这本书充斥着淡淡的忧伤，但同时又排斥人们对死的恐惧。在余华，读过这本书的人的眼里，死无葬身之地反倒成为了一句祝福，一个美好的地方，受了一辈子的苦的人最后的安慰。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;愿你在死无葬身之地安息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;（当然，有一些不太喜欢这本书，感觉写的比较敷衍-我倒觉得余华写的观点还挺新颖的，故事情节大部分也算是能接受的，可以当作闲书读一读）&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hubristic syndrome Assessing its literary applications through The Great Gatsby and Agamemnon</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/hubristic-syndrome-assessing-its-literary-applications-through-the-great-gatsby-and-agamemnon/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/hubristic-syndrome-assessing-its-literary-applications-through-the-great-gatsby-and-agamemnon/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the ancient tragedies of Greece to the modern-day downfalls of business tycoons and political leaders, the concept of hubris has served as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked power. The theme hubris was already apparent in Greek tragedies, where it mostly meant disrespecting the gods by not crediting ones’ success or fortune to the gods (Marquez, 2015), often leading to nemesis (divine retribution) and ate (ruin). The meaning of hubris has then evolved into excessive arrogance and over-confidence that leads to self-destruction (Marquez, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen coined the term hubris syndrome to describe how power can distort judgement and behavior, mostly evident in political leaders (2008). As it isn’t a diagnostic category of mental illness, Selten points out that the term still needs further validation since it’s not included in classification systems (2023), but the phenomena it describes is timeless. This syndrome can be observed in literary characters such as Agamemnon and Gatsby. Though written centuries apart, both portray characters whose personality traits lead to their tragic endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon, the first play in the Oresteia trilogy performed in 458 BCE, is one of the greatest works of classical Greek tragedy and explores the tragic downfall of Agamemnon and the revenge of Clytemnestra. Set after the Trojan war, King Agamemnon comes back home to Argos, victorious. Clytemnestra, Agamemnon’s wife, waits for him. She knows that Agamemnon has sacrificed his daughter for favorable winds in order to claim glory that rivals the gods, and harboring deep resentment, plots to kill him in order for revenge. Upon his arrival, Agamemnon further demonstrates his hubris by treading upon a sacred purple carpet, a gesture reserved for the gods, thereby further transgressing the boundaries between mortal and divine. As Cassandra, the prophet, warns him of his tragic fate, Agamemnon ignores her omens. Such disregard sets the stage for his doom as Agamemnon gets killed ultimately by Clytemnestra. His ego makes him believe that he can defy fate and his divine punishment, blinding him from reality and leading him towards death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in 1925, the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby shows a character whose hubris ultimately leads to his downfall. However, while Agamemnon’s defies fate, Gatsby clings to an unattainable dream: the revival of his relationship with Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator, meets Jay Gatsby, his neighbor, a wealthy man living in the West Egg who throws a party in his mansion every Sunday night, hoping to meet Daisy Buchanan once to rekindle their love. He ignores Daisy’s marriage with Tom Buchanan. Although, Daisy ultimately chooses Tom, Gatsby refuses to acknowledge the impossibility of his dream. His willingness to take the blame for Daisy as accidentally kills Myrtle with Gatsby’s car further illustrates his intense attitude towards chasing his dream. Jay Gatsby shows hubris in his relentless pursuit of an unattainable dream with Daisy, and his unyielding belief in his power, his ability, his wealth and status. Gatsby’s tragic ending underscores the consequences of hubris, and suggests that the American Dream, the green light he longs for, is an illusion only achieved by the privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-review&#34;&gt;Literature review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hubris syndrome, or Hubristic syndrome, is broadly investigated as a personality trait disorder. Scholars increasingly contend that hubris significantly influences many decisions by those in power. Diamandis (2018) suggests it is power which leads to such behaviors, manifesting as overconfidence, lack of self-control, and morally wrong actions. Owen agrees, claiming that the hubristic syndrome usually occurs when people hold power for a long time, making them develop an inflated view of their abilities. Owen identifies 13 symptoms characterizing this syndrome, and claims that individuals with a portrayal of over 3- 4 symptoms acquire such syndrome. For the purpose of this research, symptoms are categorized into three principal categories: vanity, overconfidence, and solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanity is an inflated sense of self (Merriam-Webster, 2025). People with such traits tend to base their actions on public perceptions, making decisions based in accordance of how others want to perceive them. Symptom 2 (a preference for taking actions in order to improve their reputation), and 3 (an unreasonable concern with image) directly reflects their occupation with image. Symptoms 1 (viewing the world as a place primarily as an area to seek power and glory), 5 (identifies their motives and outlook identical with the one of the nation) and 6 (tends to talk in third person) demonstrate the desire to create an image of supremacy (Owen, 2008). Excessive confidence is defined as being too confidence in one’s ability or decisions (Merriam-Webster, 2025). This trait involves arrogance, and an inflated sense of one’s judgements and ability, believing one has higher status than others. These symptoms are in accordance with symptom 7 (has excessive confidence of their judgement and disrespects the advice of others), 8 (believes one has supremacy in what they can achieve), and 9 (thinks they’re accountable to a higher power such as god than the public opinion) (Owen, 2008). Overconfidence would lead one to ignore their incompetence (Myers, 2019 ), leading to reckless behavior and ignorance in some problems. This is similar to that of symptoms 10 (exhibits reckless, impulsive and restless behavior),12 (tends to have a ‘broad vision’, making them ignore practical details, costs, and potential negative consequences), and 13(makes these mistakes not due to fault analysis, but due to lack of attention caused by overconfidence) (Owen, 2008). Solitude means the state of being alone from a society (Merriam-Webster, 2025). In this context, it means the isolation of oneself, often becoming detached from reality (symptom 11: loses contact with reality, becoming progressively isolated). People who have a fervent attitude on what they do, shown in symptom 4 (has a fervent attitude on the things they do and tend to have exaltation in manner), tend to further isolate them from society (Owen, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This categorization allows for a systematic analysis of hubristic traits in literary characters, examining how such traits contribute to their eventual downfall. The framework is based on the assumption that prolonged exposure to power fundamentally alters judgment, increasing susceptibility to irrational behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical literature has long examined the theme hubris, with ancient Greek tragedies portraying it as a fatal flaw that leads to severe consequences. Icarus falling to death as the flew too close to the sun (Ovid, 8 CE) demonstrates overconfidence, as he ignores Daedalus’ warnings and tries to defy human limitations. Hubris was also apparent in other works, as Doko described multiple characters such as Beowulf, King Lear, and Gatsby with such characteristics (2021). He claimed that the errors they made, for example, King Lear’s pride blocked him from distinguishing lies and the truth, becomes the reason for their tragic ends. Hidayati explored hubris syndrome in Moby Dick, arguing that Ahab’s reckless pursuit of the whale leads him to the isolation of his crew, leading to their deaths (2021). This confirms Owen’s proposition that Hubris syndrome causes irrational behaviour, leading to his tragic end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gap-and-research-question&#34;&gt;Gap and Research question
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen uses political figures in history such as George W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair to show that the hubris syndrome is applicable in real life (Owen, 2008), while Selten (2023) highlights Napoleon Bonaparte and Mao Zedong as further examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Owen’s work bridges the gap between psychological analysis and historical documentation, helping people understand how the hubris is manifested in real-life contexts. However, his emphasis on political leaders leaves room to explore hubris beyond political history, particularly in literary narratives. Hidayati, Arifuddin (2021) has already inspected its exhibition in only one book- Moby Dick, where the captain of a whale hunting vessel, Ahab portrays hubris syndrome as he constantly seeks down the white sperm whale named Moby Dick. Literature works offer insights in the potential consequences of human behavior, serving as cautionary reflections that deepen our understanding for real life. However, this article remains isolated as other literature articles analyze the theme hubris but not the syndrome. Little research systematically analyzes hubristic traits across multiple literature works in different eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that while hubristic syndrome was not formally defined until the late 20th century, its expressions are clearly evident in historical and literary figures across different eras. Choosing two literature pieces from different eras, this study will examine the presence and impact of hubristic syndrome in two distinct literary figures: Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. This  analysis will explore the specific traits associated with hubristic syndrome, trying to diagnosis the characters of this syndrome and discover how it ultimately contribute to their tragic fates. This study aims to contribute to a broader understanding of how the hubris syndrome manifests across time periods and cultural context, offering a novel application for Owen’s work. Therefore, this research seeks to answer the following question: 1) How do the characteristics of Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby manifest the hubristic syndrome as defined by Owen? 2) To what extent does their downfall illustrate the consequences of this syndrome? While not trying to validate the syndrome clinically, the study tries to provide literary validation and applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this premise, the study hypothesizes that hubristic syndrome was portrayed throughout the two pieces of literature, and served as a key factor in the downfall of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study employs a qualitative content analysis methodology (Miles and Huberman, 1994 ; Krippendorff, 2018) to investigate how hubris is depicted in literature. The primary data sources are Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. These works were selected for their thematic relevance to hubris and their influence on their respective literary traditions. The analysis seeks to identify symptoms that reflect hubristic syndrome, following Owen’s (2008) framework. Given the scope and timeframe of the study, only two pieces of literature were selected, and symptoms were extracted from a few chapters with the appearance of such character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is segmented into units including character trait or significant plot events. The study examines how these behaviors and themes are expressed within the narratives and highlights their implications, including the consequences of these hubris-driven actions. To enhance reliability, a quantitative study was employed in looking at the prevalence of each characteristic in the literature pieces. A quantitative frequency count was conducted in looking at the appearance of each trait. The appearance of symptoms in each event was counted and summed up, utilizing a basic spreadsheet software for data organization. An integration of qualitative interpretation with quantitative data allows for a nuanced understanding of the extent to which characters portray hubris syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Great Gatsby, I looked at the prevalence of each trait in chapter 2-7, where Gatsby appeared. I separated each trait into smaller symptoms, calculating the number of times each trait appeared in each chapter, and added them up to look at the total mentions. The analysis of Gatsby’s portrayal revealed a total of 44 indications of vanity, suggesting a significant emphasis on this trait in his characterization during chapter 2 to chapter 9. The data indicates that Gatsby portrayed the trait vanity most, followed by 17 mentions of excessive confidence and 13 mentions of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Agamemnon, I separated the play into different events according to Agamemnon’s actions or speech. Then I observed what symptoms each event indicated. In total, 6 symptoms were present, suggesting that Agamemnon has the hubris syndrome. With an average of 1.8 identified symptoms of hubris syndrome across the five key events analyzed in Agamemnon (Table 4), the data suggests that manifestations of hubristic traits were not isolated occurrences but rather a consistent element within the play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-vanity&#34;&gt;1. Vanity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanity is a symptom of hubris syndrome, manifesting as a deep, constant obsession with how others perceive the individual. This fixation increases the importance of one’s public persona, which becomes central to their identity. Such individuals view their image as paramount, believing that it must be perfect or associated with high power and wealth in order to achieve superiority. This behavior leads to constant efforts in consolidating their social position, control how others see them, and any perceived threat to this image—such as criticism or failure—may provoke defensive or aggressive reactions. Not only so, individuals start to put emphasis on the voices of others, highly aware of how others would perceive them, thoroughly thinking on how to act to maintain such image (Webster, 2014). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portrayed a great extent of concern with image, Agamemnon as maintaining his image as loyal and obedient to the gods, and Gatsby as maintaining his fake image as the wealthy and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the war, Agamemnon is greeted by Clytemnestra who urges him to step onto the crimson carpets, only greeted by the feet of the gods to step upon (Britannica, 2024). His hesitation upon the offer reveals his anxiety over appearing arrogant in front of the gods and his citizens. He states that only such commodities could only be used on god, politely declining Clytemnestra’s offer. He also refuses with ‘the people murmur, and their voice is great in strength’ (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.938), concerned that his disobedience towards the gods would wreck his image among citizens. Ultimately, he gives in, rationalizing his behavior through Clytemnestra’s suggestion. This uncertainty contrasts sharply with his prior decisiveness during the sacrifice of his daughter, showing an unreasonable concern with image. During the sacrifice, he defiantly issued commands without hesitation and acknowledgment of other people’s thoughts, claiming - “May it be well” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.217). This suggests an inconsistent evaluation of his public image relative to political ambition, making his concerns unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in The Great Gatsby, Gatsby exhibits a relentless commitment in constructing his image of wealth and status. Although originating from a humble origin, he is concerned with his fake image of immense wealth and status to fit into the world of the elite. As he tells Nick, the narrator, of his background, “His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west- all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.70), he puts emphasize on his family wealth and education but the vagueness suggests an intentional fabrication, intended to help him fit into high society. Moreover, he repeatedly emphasizes his image, including his financial status. When Nick questioned his wealth “I thought you inherited your money?” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96), he responds automatically with the narrative below: “I did, old sport” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic- the panic of the war” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96). He instinctively tries to maintain his titled image. Although his response suits the tone of the upperclassmen, it highlights the fragility of his persona. If he inherited his money, he never should’ve needed 3 years to earn it. The contradictions indicate that Gatsby is concerned with image as his entire existence is built around it, making any disruption of his image vulnerable to his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-excessive-confidence&#34;&gt;2. Excessive Confidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive confidence leads to poor decision making as it tends to cause individuals to overestimate their abilities or underestimate the challenges they’re facing. Overconfidence is sometimes beneficial as it boosts morale, ambition and increases one’s competition and survival (Johnson &amp;amp; Fowler, 2011). However, excessive confidence can lead to blindness and may impair self-reflection, making failure a persistent outcome in one’s journey (Hidayati et.al. 2021). Fast asserts that when people experience power, they tend to make overconfident decisions that lead to negative outcomes, or ultimately, personal downfall (2011). Overconfidence can be manifested in three different aspects, 1) in the overplacement of believing one to have superior performance than others, 2) in overpercision regarding the accuracy of one’s judgements, 3) in overestimating one’s performance abilities (Moore &amp;amp; Healy, 2007). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portray this trait, exhibiting unwavering faith in their goals, leading to negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also shows overconfidence in his decision to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. Although Agamemnon experiences internal struggle regarding the sacrifice, he ultimately does so. However, he fails to see the consequences after sacrificing his daughter to secure victory in the Trojan War. Additionally, this act highlights his authority as he is able to extert control over the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once trapped, she wept, called on her father’s name— as if Iphigeneia’s maidish scream could move his crew of genocidophiles, his entourage of death-squads; or move him.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.228)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He commands soldiers to hold Iphiegnia down, asserting his authority while ignoring her pleas of life. His disregards demonstrate his belief in absolute authority, extending to family members, revealing a detachment from moral responsibility and familial compassion. He is confident to assume that he can compel others to participate in this horrific act without consequence. He overestimates his power regarding the lives of his family, since he sees himself as the one who can determine the fate of those around him, including his daughter. He neglects how Clytemnestra thinks, and thus fails to consider the consequences the act would bring to the whole family. “So with relief he gave it Necessity’s name. Once necked in his yoke, though, we smelt off him something unclean, something desanctified, something set free to defile; new look in his face that said All is permitted for me.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.218)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon rationalizes his decision by calling it a necessity, convincing himself that it was inevitable. He aligns such matters with the act of the whole nation, claiming it to be for the sake of war. While he frames his decision for the benefit of the nation, the essence of the war was driven my personal motives in retrieving Helen. As he accepts the sacrifice, he no longer seems bound by moral constraints, as if he now believes he can do anything. This could imply his corrupting nature of power and the moral decay that follows his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence also lies in his conviction that his sacrifice is justified for the sake of victory. His desire of victory, that is, to bring Helen back, to demonstrate the powers of the Greek supersedes the lives of those around him, including his own daughter. The morally questionable decision made by him seems to bring harm as he fails to estimate the moral consequences that would bring him. He sees his vision of the future (victory in Troy) as so important that it justifies any action, including extreme violence, like sacrificing Iphigenia. His reckless behaviour (symptom 10) is portrayed through the chorus elder’s words, “So I won’t try to hide from you, my lord, that when you led your army forth—for Helen— you cut a figure I could not applaud. Your plan seemed ill-conceived and uncompelling: to send an army out to die in war to win back what—a voluntary whore?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.800). The elder exposes a deep skepticism toward the rationale for the Trojan expedition, suggesting that Agamemnon’s actions were perceived as impulsive, irrational, and reckless. This critique implies Agamemnon’s reckless acts, pointing to a broader erosion of confidence in Agamemnon’s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon shows overconfidence through his dismissals of the consequences happening in his palace. He ignores the warnings from Cassandra, the oracle; and he portrays no remorse for his daughter after winning the war. Agamemnon’s greatest threat comes from within his own home. Clytemnestra has spent years plotting his demise, seeking both revenge for Iphigenia and power over Argos. Even when Cassandra warns him of his impending doom, Agamemnon dismisses the danger, assuming that no one in his household would dare challenge him. Upon being struck down, he claims “And now—in my own house—you strike me down?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.1344). The phrase ‘in my house’ further depicts his  surprise; he perceives his household as an extension of his power, not anticipating any disobedience. Ultimately, Clytemnestra’s act dismantles Agamemnon’s belief and illusion in achieving supremacy and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence blinds him from suspecting betrayal and leaves him vulnerable, unable to defend himself when the moment of vengeance arrives. In the end, his overconfidence—his certainty that no one, especially not his wife, could defy him—proves to be his undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Gatsby shows immense confidence in his ability to recreate his relationship with Daisy. He believes that their love has remained unchanged, despite Daisy’s marriage to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby is certain that he could rekindle their love, making him ignore potential limitations. This is portrayed through his words in chapter 6, “‘Repeat the past?’ He cried incredulously, ‘why of course you can!’&amp;hellip; ‘I’m going to fix
everything just the way it was before,’ he said, nodding determinedly, ‘she’ll see.’” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.118).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby’s overconfidence blinds him to Daisy’s divided loyalties. As Nick tells him about Daisy’s attachment with Tom, he refutes with “‘I don’t think she ever loved him.’ Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.137). His refusal to acknowledge Daisy’s past and love life with Tom illustrates his excessive confidence in his judgment and his disregard of the advice of others. His entire faith had been built on the fantasy that Daisy’s love would return to him. However, he was blinded by confidence and failed to account for the gap between reality and fantasy, contributing to his final downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-loneliness&#34;&gt;3. Loneliness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling occurring in a person when one’s social network is too small or lacks emotional closeness. The feeling arises either when one has few friends or when the intimacy of such relationships hasn’t been fulfilled (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). Prolonged loneliness then progresses into isolation, a social condition rather than a feeling. Isolation occurs when an individual feels alone because they are, in fact, disconnected from others—whether due to the absence of relationships or the failure to establish deep emotional bonds. This state of isolation is particularly harmful because it reinforces feelings of helplessness, inadequacy, and emotional emptiness. As Hunt et al. (2017) highlight, prolonged loneliness and isolation can have detrimental effects on a person&amp;rsquo;s physical and mental health, contributing to a weakened immune system, cardiovascular diseases, suicidal behavior and dementia. Loneliness is influenced by various factors, including the quality and availability of relationships, personality traits, societal norms, and an individual&amp;rsquo;s capacity to adjust to changing circumstances (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). This understanding of loneliness can be applied to The Great Gatsby, as Gatsby’s illusion in the American Dream distances himself from society, while Agamemnon doesn’t exhibit significant signs of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon, unlike Gatsby, does not distance himself from reality, nor is he stuck in his illusions. He aspires to win the Trojan War, which results in tangible achievements. He does not have a fervent attitude in trying to achieve any goals. It could be pointed out that he is fervent in trying to attain absolute power and supremacy, particularly in his belief of his power over life and death, but it isn’t depicted much in the text. His pursuit of his goals suggests more of a reliance on his status as a king that supports his execution of orders, rather than using a fervent attitude. This contrasts with Gatsby, who centers his character in a passionate pursuit of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is stuck in his illusions, disassociating himself from reality. He’s stuck in his beliefs, sure that he will attain the American Dream he pursued relentlessly, and that Daisy will come back. The narrator mentioned Gatsby standing at the dock, staring into the distance. He commented, “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.” (Fitzgerald, 1925 p.193). Gatsby is devoted to his dream. He is obsessed, so much that it turns into a symbol of his undying hope, becoming a central part of his identity. He chases it fervently, slowly isolating himself from society. Even with the huge parties he has thrown, he still feels emotionally isolated as nobody truly understands him. This disassociation also appears at the end of the book, where no one comes to his funeral except Nick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of Gatsby’s fervent attitude towards his illusions is when he invites Daisy to afternoon tea. After he asks Daisy to afternoon tea at Nick’s cottage, he looks at the surroundings and ordered for Nick’s grass to be cut. “The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.” (Fitzgerald, 1926, p. 90). While it would be customary to bring a few flowers for such an occasion, Gatsby decides to overwhelm the cottage with an excessive amount of flowers, transforming it into a greenhouse. This reflects his intensity and passion in trying to rekindle his romance with Daisy, aligning with symptom 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.100). Gatsby here shows Daisy around his mansion, while they were standing at the balcony, looking into the green light. During the moment, Gatsby briefly recognizes that his whole identity was based on pursuing the idealized version of Daisy, which was someone who he could never attain. Even the Daisy right beside him was unattainable due to social and personal barriers between them. Nevertheless, instead of accepting this realization, Gatsby chooses to suppress his doubts and continue chasing his vision with even greater intensity. This denial of reality not only illustrates Gatsby’s deepening obsession but also marks the beginning of his progressive isolation, as he increasingly distances himself from the world as it truly is in favor of his unattainable ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the three main traits of hubris syndrome to interpret the characteristics of the Agamemnon and Gatsby; the results show that Agamemnon and Gatsby both portray Hubris syndrome summed up by three main traits: Vanity, Overconfidence and Loneliness. Gatsby fabricates a background of wealth and prestige to maintain his constructed identity. He displays overconfidence in estimating his abilities of winning Daisy back, making him ignore Daisy’s dilemma. His fervent attitude in chasing the American dream makes him isolated. His relentless pursuit of the dream caused Daisy to abandon him and led him to his demise. Agamemnon shows concern with his image as he returns home. He seeks for power and greatness, but he is concerned of vengeance from the gods. He demonstrates overconfidence by killing his daughter, convinced it was a necessary act. He is confident that it’s the right decision, but he is blinded and unaware of the plotting inside the palace to kill him. Although so, he shows little isolation as he didn’t portray exaltation in his actions. His overconfidence and pride eventually led to his death, participating in his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results provide additional support for Owen’s application of Hubris syndrome (2008). The portrayal of Hubris Syndrome by the two characters suggests the recurring presence of such syndrome across fictional portrayals from different periods. Hubris syndrome is related with each of the characters’ tragic endings, suggesting that it could bring detrimental effects if not dealt with carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations-implications-and-further-research&#34;&gt;Limitations, Implications and Further Research
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations that should be considered. First, regarding internal validity, the content analysis was conducted by one person without peer discussions or cross- validation, making interpretations subjective and reducing the consistency of the findings. This also reduces reliability, as interpretations may differ if repeated by other researchers. In addition, the two passages selected were from western literature on male characters, making it not as generalizable to other cultures or gender perspectives, where hubristic traits could vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this still shows that hubris syndrome dominates the plot trajectories, illustrating that hubris syndrome plays a role in one’s tragic ending. Manifestations of the syndrome could also support its broad range of application, even in literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could consider analysing hubristic syndrome in different cultures, for example, eastern culture or females to further broaden the applicability of findings. There could also be in depth interviews or discussions with one or more researchers to enhance the validity and reliability of interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Babel读后感</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/babel%E8%AF%BB%E5%90%8E%E6%84%9F/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/babel%E8%AF%BB%E5%90%8E%E6%84%9F/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently read Babel by R. F. Kuang, an amazing book. What I really loved was character development, the themes Kuang discussed, and how deeply the story resonates with me. At the heart of the novel is Robin, a Chinese student who is ‘adopted’ by Professor Lovell and sent to study translation at Oxford, in the institution known as Babel, during the 19th century. As Robin navigates life in a colonial world, he faces deep identity struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I remembered the most was when Robin and his friends discovered that the Britain people were sending Opium into China and using it to trade for silver. This is a topic I was already familiar with from my history lessons, so reading about it in this context felt natural to me. The historical backdrop added layers of depth to the narrative, making Robin’s journey feel urgent and real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The themes of resistance and powerlessness in the face of systemic oppression were especially poignant. Robin and his friends’ efforts feel futile against the already set plans of a colonial system. I could relate to their sense of despair, witnessing countless situations when systems are so deeply entrenched that individual action may seem powerless. However, the actions they took struck me. They sacrificed their bodies and used whatever power they had to draw attention to the injustice. The determination they had in their beliefs left a lasting impression on me.&lt;br&gt;
Kuang’s depictions of Robin’s thoughts and movements during his interrogation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment when Robin destroys the silver bars Kuang’s descriptions were so vivid that I felt as if I could hear the ringing of the silver, see the tower collapse, and feel the mix of despair and resolve the characters were experiencing. These sensory details—combined with the emotional weight of their actions—made the story feel alive to me. It felt like an experience I could sense, almost as if I was standing right alongside Robin, feeling the heartbreak of his choices. Kuang’s novels made me think about justice, right and wrong, and her, making me think of deep themes left me in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Final Project</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/final-project/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/final-project/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood curling screams. Blood that runs like a river. Flesh molded together. Tangled and scattered limbs. Achilles stood in front of him. The head of the spear flew close to him. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. Then it was pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucifying pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bronze dagger seemed to pierce through frozen time as it inched towards Hector’s abdominal. It burst right through his sides, and heat seemed to spread towards his whole body. He looked down and thought he’d seen red run up towards him. His eyes slowly closed as the ground rushed to greet him. Is this how it’s supposed to end? The hero, defender of Troy, lay slack on the grounds, as he watched the Greek trample down his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time Hector opened his eyes, he saw white. Am I dead? That thought lingered in his head like an echo. Holographic words appeared in the air, somewhat like on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start game?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wha-”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below was a button with the letters enter on it. What’s this all about? Hector thought. No time to response, a cold voice spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Detecting regret and remorse… Preparing to enter the game in 3, 2-”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring Hector’s cries, the settings around him started to change. The humming sounds turned louder and louder, morphing into the cicadas chirping in the summer night. The white walls faded, revealing somewhere familiar. Looking around, Hector saw his bedroom. Sitting up on his bed, he moved towards the mirror, only to see a child staring back at him. His muscled arms, chiseled face was gone, replaced by short limbs and a chubby face. It was him as a child, his black and unruly curls hanging on his head, wide olive eyes curiously observing everything around him, trying to comprehend the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He jumped slightly at hearing the words, looking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who’s there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hello, Hector. This is system 3457. Detecting the regrets of your death, we decided to give you a few more chances to reach peace with your endings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is absurd.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life is absurd.” System 3457 replied, tone unchanging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector paused to take in the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What should I do exactly?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that helps you relieve the pain of your death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what do you do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I try my best to assist you. But it is mostly you who tries to change your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh-”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector started, before a sudden wail of the baby cut the conversation short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector’s head turned and walked towards the door, opening the door slightly. Sneaking a peek out of the door, a messy tuft of hair stood out as he listened to his father and mother discussing what to do with the baby. Paris. Words like ‘prophecy’, ‘fate’, ‘kill’, and ‘Mount Ida’ reached his ears, and with widened eyes, he understood what happened. He was back to the night when his parents decided to throw Paris to Mount Ida. There Paris would grow as a man, and bring destruction to Troy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destruction… Hector shuddered as he remembered how Achilles’ sword threw itself into him, bringing crucifying heat. He never wanted to experience it again. And there Paris lay, he wasn’t hidden in the mists, from which Aphrodite created. Quiet and sound asleep, he lay still like a lamb. Helpless. Just a feeble child, sound asleep, Hector mused. His eyes shifted towards his wall, where a dagger hang. How had the aggressor felt when the metal tip met flesh, bringing blood? Was it relief? Or was it joy, freeing him of his burdens? Or was it remorse that clung onto him and haunted him long after the blood dried? His fingers brushed the dagger, the cool of bronze calming his nerves. His father’s words echoed in his mind.  For you, Hector. We hope you’d use this dagger in the future not to torment, but to provide protection for the helpless. May it lay on the wall and keep as a reminder to stay true to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His breath hitched as he reached for the dagger. With shaking hands, he gripped onto the hilt and edged towards the door. Paris lay still, as if waiting for his trial to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clang. That was the sound of the dagger dropping onto the floor. He couldn’t. It pained Hector’s heart as he couldn’t put himself to strike down his brother who had the same blood running in his veins, the same flesh that built his body, and the same soul that breathed life into him. How could he end a person, a child’s life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if he did nothing, Troy will burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mind raced. &lt;em&gt;I have to stop him. If I keep him, will he doom us all? What if I took him away?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector closed his eyes, his breath shaking as his mind raced. He had to do something. But what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he had a chance to act, King Priam and Queen Hecuba came back. Hector lay beside the door, heart racing as he listened to them talk. Their minds were set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s keep him.” Queen Hecuba muttered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Paris stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paris grew, Hector was always by his side. He taught Paris what it took to be a prince, a ruler of the country. He taught him the importance of land, and power, and showed him what a king should do to his subjects for a better world. Hector gave Paris ambition and told him about responsibility. He made sure that Paris was loyal to his kingdom, loyal to his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the balcony of the palace, Hector stood beside Paris, viewing Troy and its people as they ran their everyday errands. Paris stood there, with awe and wonder, “Am I really going to rule over this terrain? This many people, under my command?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector spoke softly, “Yes. You should know, Paris, responsibility comes along with the crown. The only love you should ever hold in your heart is towards your kingdom, your civilians. Love Troy and cherish it. Don’t ever give it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris nodded. He paused for a moment, soaking Hector’s words into his mind. He watched a pair below as they walked along the streets. They seemed content, smiling shyly towards each other, speaking softly. They seemed in love. Paris cherished it. He was going to keep it safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d never.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector lectured him on politics, on war. He excelled at his studies, and treated every one of his subjects with love and respect. The people of Troy adored him. Merchants greeted him with gifts, warriors bowed to him whenever he passed by, poets wrote poems about his beauty, and girls followed him as he walked down the road. Even nymphs in the woods whispered his name, and from Mount Olympus, Zeus watched him with interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris grew into a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the goddess Eris finally dropped the golden apple, for the most beautiful, down onto Mount Olympus, it caused chaos. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena argued for the apple, each believing it was them as the most beautiful. So Zeus invited Paris up to select the fairest of them all. Paris obliged, but it was hard for him to do so. Thus, the goddesses each bribed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hera stepped forward, her presence commanding as she spoke “I will offer you the rule of the land of Europe and Asia. With such lands, you will make Troy the greatest empire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athena’s grey eyes gleamed as she offered him the skill and wisdom in battles and wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aphrodite stepped forward, and spoke softly “I will offer you love- love with the most beautiful woman in the world- Helen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He slowly weighed each of the options. As a king, the most important thing he valued was his subjects, his land. Hera’s option of offering him the lands of Europe and Asia seemed the best for him. It could greatly increase Troy’s powers. His decision was made. He chose Hera. Smug and victorious, Hera kept her promise. Athena and Aphrodite retired from the stage, downcast and resentful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the results of this judgment, Hector breathed a sigh of relief. &lt;em&gt;Does this mean the Trojan War will disappear?&lt;/em&gt; He thought to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what happened must happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece still declared war on Troy. They claimed that it was because Troy had gotten too much land for them that once belonged to the Greeks. The Trojan War that Hector had tried so hard to prevent still came. Listening to the war cry of the people outside, Hector sighed as he and Paris plunged into war.
Like what happened before, Achilles came towards Hector, demanding a fight. Hector did what he could, but the spear pierced through him, erupting heat through his sides. Hector’s knees buckled. He closed his eyes, admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it was again. The cold, white ceiling swam into focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wha-”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector sprung up again, on his bed. Demanding his short legs to move down from the bed, he stared back at the child in the mirror. Realization dawned over him, suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flat voice echoed in the room. “Hector. Pleased to meet you again. Detecting your regret and confusion, we decided to give you another chance.”
Hector sighed. “How many times do I have left?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s up to you. It’s lasts until you’ve reached satisfaction on your completion of the task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hera promised land. Aphrodite promised love. Paris chose them and it all led to the destruction of Troy. Athena promised wisdom. Wisdom could bring power, and a strategic mind would be beneficial to war. Could that be it?&lt;/em&gt; Hector thought. Perhaps, he mused, perhaps, he could still challenge fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Hector took this chance and started the game. This time, rather than letting Paris understand the power and responsibilities kings have, he took Paris to the library and encouraged him to read. He guided Paris through ancient texts, revealing philosophies of scholars. Paris listened, eyes wide and gleaming as Hector told him about the battles the kings fought, the bizarre adventures they had on the road. Paris loved the encounters of love the kings had, and wondered if he could ever meet the one, and Hector smiled, softly promising that he would, someday. But after that sentence, Hector would always tell him to focus on the next paragraph of the ancient text. He showed him the charm of knowledge, and the importance of wisdom. Paris trained in the arena for hours each day, his movements fluid and swift, his bronze sword gleaming under the sun with each and every move. Paris dueled often with other soldiers, and loved the sweet taste of victory. Paris’ still looked pretty. He had toned and muscular body, and moved with the fluid grace of a sculpted god. Wherever he went, eyes lingered, cheeks flushed and giggles arouse. Zeus took notice of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the day rolled around when Eris dropped the golden apple. Paris was summoned by Zeus to pick out the fairest goddess. After listening to their bribes, Paris hesitated. He was torn between choosing Aphrodite and Athena, but he longed for knowledge. He chose Athena. Gaining all the wisdom of battles, Paris was indestructible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally.&lt;/em&gt; Hector muttered to himself, this way, even if the war happened, we’d be able to fend off the Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Paris had the wisdom of the battles, he met his inevitable fate. Paris gained so much fame that every girl, every nymph wanted to take a look at him. So did Helen. She went away from her hometown, and arrived at Troy.  As Paris saw her, his eyes widened. He gentle smile and glimmering eyes- he knew that she was the one. They fell in love. However, Helen was supposed to be engaged to one of her suitors in Greece. The Greeks were enraged, and declared war.  Again, the Trojan War happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aphrodite, enraged, cast a curse on him, making Helen, and nothing else his top priority. As Paris stood at the edge of the battlefield, listening to the clinging of swords and the cries of soldiers, he felt torn. He longed to fight, he wanted to feel the adrenaline pulsing through his skin, wanted to see how enemies would kneel before him, and how Helen would embrace him, learning that they’ve won. But Helen. He couldn’t bear the thought of leaving sweet, kind Helen. He longed to see her gentle smile and feel her touch. With a heavy heart, he turned away from the battlefield and into the safe palace with Helen. Cold dread creeped up Hector’s bones. He closed his eyes, admitting defeat. The bronze spear pierced through him, erupting crimson as Hector groaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Again!?” Hector cried in agony when he sat up from bed, his backside throbbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System 3457’s flat voice echoed against the room. “Yes, again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know what, 3457? I’m done. I never should’ve interfered with Paris’ life. He can do whatever he wants. I’ll just stay away from the fight.” He pushed the guilt in his heart down, retreating back into the shadows. Hector stayed in his room and tuned out the infant’s cries. He would live his own life, and take his family away from the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he saw Paris bringing Helen back, Hector felt a chill running through his arms. He knew that it was time to leave. He brought the bags he prepared a few weeks ago, and led his wife and children out of the gates. He knew that he was being a coward, as he fled with the family and left the city behind. But he was determined that it was for the better good, as he was not willing to make losing them the consequences of pride. As he grabbed his bags and went out to get his family, he saw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moonlight glinted of the sword in the night, dangerously close to his family’s throat. His children huddled close to his wife. Hector, desperate, cried out “Spare my family! Please!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He saw his father standing beside the grim soldiers. His father’s face was filled with tears. King Priam whispered: “I’m truly sorry, Hector. But you have to go to war. Without you, there wouldn’t be anyone to lead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hector hesitated, but it all disappeared when he saw the fear in his children’s wide eyes. He tried to take a step forward but was forced to stop when the knife edged closer to their throats. He thought he saw red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a sigh, he replied. “Fine. I will join the fight. Just… keep my family safe. Please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a heavy heart, he stepped dejectedly onto the battlefield. The understood what waited for him. His sides ached as he met Achilles. Even so, he fought, desperate to alter the inevitable. But he knew that his attempts were futile. The spear pierced through him. Pain seized him and he cried in agony, eyes closing and surrendered to the darkness that surrounded him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“3457.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Hector?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If fate was inevitable, why am I still here? I failed every time trying to stop death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Death and fate are all inevitable, Hector. A man must go through death. You can try and change the process, but the ending is already predetermined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then why bother?” Hector grumbled, his voice laced with bitterness. “If fate was already predetermined, aren’t we free of our responsibilities? We can do whatever we want but the ending never changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot answer your question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I knew my fate was death, why should I even put effort into anything? What’s the point in doing anything?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is it the destination or the journey that defines us, Hector?”
Hector went silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“See, Hector. We gave you more chances because we sensed regret and discontent with your choices. We never asked you to change your ending, that is running away from the problem. Think about the process.”
Hector scoffed. “What am I supposed to do in the process? Just calmly take in the fact that I died in the war and allows Achilles to drag my body through the battlefield for shame?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That question is out of my parameters, Hector. But you focus too much on the endings that you forget the joy you receive during the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process? How can the process be good when you’re immersed in the agony of knowing your future and understanding that you can’t do anything to change it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Isn’t suffering the thing that makes you cherish the moment of joy?”
System 3457 paused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot enlighten you just in this short conversation, Hector. I am not in charge of your life, I cannot solve all of your problems. YOU should be the one to solve all this.”
What about the process? Hector lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. Did I feel joy in the process? Or was it all just suffering?
Joy was there. It was a fleeting sensation in the face of despair. I did feel joy when reuniting with my family. There was satisfaction when Paris listened to my advice when he truly relied on me. I was content with my life when I focused on the present, and never thought about the agony that would arrive… Could these moments really outweigh the dread he felt during his death?
Does the journey define me or does the ending define me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll try, 3457.” His voice was firm. Ignoring his trembling hands, he jumped down from his bed. “I’ll try again. To enjoy, to understand.”&lt;br&gt;
With that one last thought, he headed towards the door, into the uncertain dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the extent to which loss aversion varies across age and gender
in China. Employing an online, survey-based method, this study uses econometric
approaches (regression models and the utility function in stata) and examines Chinese people
of all ages and genders to assess loss aversion through mixed lottery questions. The findings
are inconsistent with the hypothesis, revealing that gender and age aren’t significantly related
to loss aversion. There seemed to be no significant differences between women and men,
although men are a bit more loss-averse than women. Older people are found to be more loss-
averse than younger people. These results contribute to the understanding of loss aversion in
a cultural context and provide new insights into gender differences. Questions and research
topics are proposed for further understanding and further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ： &lt;em&gt;Loss aversion, risk, gender, age, China, behavioral economics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction-and-literature-review&#34;&gt;1. Introduction and Literature review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss aversion, a phenomenon when a loss is viewed as more emotionally severe compared to
an equivalent game, is suggested by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Proposed in 1979,
this topic has become increasingly popular in research, producing dozens of studies in areas
such as finance, psychology, politics, and marketing. Loss aversion is key in every aspect of
our daily lives, since the extent of it, rather than its general occurrence, makes it a crucial
factor in decision-making (Schmidt, 2002). By understanding the mechanisms of loss
aversion, insights on human behavior can be recognised and strategies for mitigating its
impact can be developed. This study aims to dive back into the nature of loss aversion,
investigating how age and gender factors interact with it, shaping each individual’s responses
in acting towards losses in the context of China. By looking into the findings, the study can
provide a more nuanced understanding of decision-making and new insights.
The relationship between loss aversion and age and gender is a popular research area, not to
mention the numerous other research studies on abundant factors impacting loss aversion.
The mechanisms of loss aversion have already been widely explored. But turning back to the
basics of loss aversion, Gächter points out the effect of socio-demographic variables on loss
aversion, stating that it increases with age, income, and wealth and decreases with education
(2021). However, inconsistencies have arisen, debating the significance the variables have on
loss aversion, especially gender. Gächter (2021) claims that gender differences aren’t
significant in loss aversion while other studies report that female participants have shown a
higher degree of loss aversion than male participants (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari,
2015). Such arguments have led to the confusion of whether loss aversion was really affected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by gender- if so, to what extent? Heated debates on the gender differences in risk preferences
and loss aversion have led to several hypotheses and explanations and numerous research
results. This study hopes to provide a point and use the results to verify one’s own theory. On
the other hand, the variable age has been mostly consistent among various studies, asserting
that older people show a higher frequency of loss aversion than young adults (Arora and
Kumari, 2015; Gächter, 2021; Albert and Duffy, 2012), and so has education and income
(Gächter, 2021; Blake, Cannon and Wright, 2021), although there has been a lack of
explanation of why was age correlated with loss aversion. How these socio-demographic
factors influence loss aversion have been conducted numerous times in different countries, in
areas such as the US, India, and Germany respectively (Albert and Duffy, 2012; Arora and
Kumari, 2015; Gächter, 2021; Schmidt, 2002). Nevertheless, a paucity of research appeared
in the area of China, leading to uncharted questions: are the factors consistent between each
country? Do different cultures shape individuals’ choices differently? Wang et al. show that
different cultures do shape individuals’ choices, changing the way they perceive risks (2016).
The divergence of Chinese culture from others might impact their decision-making, making
this study wonder how and why it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-methodology&#34;&gt;2. Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-hypothesis&#34;&gt;2.1 Hypothesis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the studies done before, the study came up with two hypotheses.
Supposing the results of most countries are consistent, the findings should be similar to those
of the other studies. This study believed that: first, age is positively correlated with loss
aversion, meaning that the older people get, the more loss averse they are. Second, gender is
significantly correlated with loss aversion, and female participants show a larger extent of
loss aversion than male participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-experiment-design&#34;&gt;2.2 Experiment design
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used a survey approach and sent questionnaires through social media platforms.
Wenjuanxing, a popular and convenient website in China for making surveys and collecting
results was used. The participants were selected from different provinces in China, though
most were in Beijing. In a total of 100 participants, 56 males and 44 females volunteered to
participate. They varied around age, with children concentrating mostly on high school
students while adults were scattered between the ages of 20 and 80. They weren’t given any
remunerations or refreshments after finishing the survey. The time they used was short, under
5 minutes, and they relied on their senses, not using any help from the internet or friends. The
data was collected and saved on Wenjuanxing, enabling later access. The data were then
downloaded onto Excel for further processing and were analyzed by Stata.
The participants all took the same survey, first asking for mostly background questions,
determining variables such as age, gender, education level, and income level. Then a set of
loss aversion questions were given out (see Appendix 1). The participants had to choose
between receiving no money or having half the probability of receiving money (100 RMB)
and the other half losing money (starting with 90 and gradually decreasing to 10 RMB). To
confirm the predictions and exclude errors, three more questions measuring loss aversion
were set (Appendix 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No exact model was used to measure loss aversion. This study used the combination
of a few different methods in the hope of attaining more accurate results. In the first part, loss
aversion is determined by the participant switching point and the total score in deciding to
participate in the game; in the second part, loss aversion is determined by the total score of
the three questions. The greater the total scores were, the more loss averse they were in the
second part (3 as lowest and 6 as highest) and the less they were in the first part (9 as lowest
and 18 as full marks). These scores are then regressed with the variables using Stata,
calculating their p-values. To ensure credibility, the loss aversion coefficient for the first part
was also measured and regressed with stata. The calculation of this model was a simplified
version of Kahneman and Tversky’s model for measuring loss aversion. It was calculated
using the two utility functions for gains and losses respectively. Due to the lack of data in
calculating the values for alpha and beta in the utility function, this was simplified into a
linear model for more convenient measures.&lt;/p&gt;
$$
U(x) = x^{\alpha} \quad (x &gt; 0)
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
U(x) = -\lambda (-x)^{\beta} \quad (x &lt; 0)

          &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 100 effective responses. With the wide range of age (14 to 80, with the
mean age around 37.4), it was split into three groups, children, adults and elders to help
distinguish the differences. Children were below 18, adults ranged from 18 to 59, and elders
were 60 and above. Age and gender were independent variables, and education level and
income level were control variables (the two had a close mean value, 4.27 and 4.12).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average amount of money willing to lose during the first part of the game (the
turning point) was 59.8 and the average of the score in the second part was 4.770. There were
some inconsistencies between the first and second part, as the less loss averse participants
weren’t mostly the ones who chose to participate in games in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependent variables (Loss Aversion total score in part 1, the Turning point, Loss
Aversion coefficient, Loss Aversion total score in part 2 respectively) in the table actually
shows that loss aversion isn’t related significantly with gender and age. The other socio-
demographic factors, such as education and income level also isn’t significantly related with
loss aversion, the p-value being larger than 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*** p&amp;lt;0.01 **p&amp;lt;0.05 *p&amp;lt;0.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the calculation of the loss aversion coefficient, the elders were the most
loss averse, showing the highest average loss aversion coefficient (3.904), then the adults
(2.752), and lastly the children (2.524). However, the loss aversion coefficient of male
participants (2.89 7 ) were higher than those of female participants (2.60 2 ), showing that males
were actually more loss averse than females. No significant pattern of income level or
education level was found in loss aversion habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four participants were considered as the extreme of loss aversion, as they didn’t
choose to participate in the first part of the survey at all and had a greater average score of
loss aversion in the second part (5.250). 3 of 4 the participants considered as extreme were
male, while other variables showed no obvious pattern. 33 participants were considered as
slightly less loss averse, having a total score of 18 in the first part and a score of 4.576 in the
second part, showing no significant pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-discussion&#34;&gt;4. Discussion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multiple methods of analysis, it was concluded that the hypothesis was wrong:
age and gender are not significantly correlated with loss aversion. However, the average
value of the loss coefficient proved that older people were more loss-averse than younger
people, and men were more loss-averse than men. Such findings were inconsistent with other
studies. This study then aims to provide new insights, giving out reasons and suggesting why
the results weren’t significantly correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-gender-and-loss-aversion&#34;&gt;4.1 Gender and loss aversion.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study are inconsistent Schmidt’s’ and the others. Gender has no
significant correlation with loss aversion and by looking at extreme values and the
comparison of loss aversion coefficient, women tend to be less loss averse than men. In most
studies, though, women are explained to be more loss-averse than men because they exhibit
less risk-taking actions than men. According to the evolutionary explanation suggested by
Trivers and extended by Buss, women have a higher biological investment in producing
offsprings due to gestation and birth, giving them a more cautious approach to giving birth,
making them less risk-taking. On the contrary, men have a lower biological investment,
highly increasing their reproduction success by having sex with multiple mates. This could
derive from their risk-taking behavior since they’d gain more resources (2019). Today&amp;rsquo;s
choices can still stem from biological roots, making women more loss-averse since the losses
they have to consider wouldn’t be equal to their gains. The findings shown by Harris and
Jekins match up with this theory (2023), and the results of a lot of other studies are consistent
with the theory (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study, though, refute this hypothesis. The perception that men are
more risk-taking than women due to innate reasons could be wrong. Born as a general
species, homo-sapiens, they might not have any risk preferences or loss preferences at the
start. Biological needs for survival could be the foundation but not the main reason for loss
aversion. It is further education, stereotypes that highly contrasts the difference between men
and women, lead to a subconscious thought (women are more loss averse than men),
therefore framing them and increasing the difference between genders. But nowadays, with
the advocates of gender equality, the ideas that women can do anything men can, and
education with no discrimination, the perceived difference between men and women might
decrease, leading to no significant divergence or correlation in gender differences and loss
aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a hypothesis is similar to Solvic’s. Solvic comes up with a different explanation
than the evolutionary theory for gender differences. He states that women engage more in
risk-taking activities than men because they are more familiar with these risks than men.
Women often face societal expectations and pressures, forming their risk attitude. Cultural
contexts can also influence how different genders respond to risks (1987). In China,
traditional thoughts such as gender roles highlight the significance of women as caregivers,
and housewives, fostering a more risk-averse mindset since they are supposed to prioritize
the well-being of others. Men are considered breadwinners, cultivating a more risk-taking
attitude since ambition and assertion are required to make money. Psychological factors also
suggest that gender differences tend to contribute to divergent outcomes. Women tend to put
a greater emphasis on the potential negative outcomes compared with men, making them
more loss-averse and less risk-taking. Solvic believes that it is the familiarity with risks that
makes women engage in social risks more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such findings in this study don’t match up with the explanations. This could
be possible due to the prevalence of feminism, encouraging gender equality. Hu and Scott
reported that people’s attitudes toward gender roles prescribing a traditional gender division
of labor had significantly less support in China (2016). Traditional ideas of gender roles and
patrilineal thoughts are continuously challenged, implying that women face less societal
pressures and are encouraged to participate more fully in the workforce. This could increase
women’s risk-taking attitude, perhaps leading to less loss-averse choices. With societal norms
increasing equality, education, and job opportunities, and prevailing new ideas, perhaps men
would feel challenged or turn to a new way of thinking, decreasing their willingness to take
risks, and making them more loss-averse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-age-and-loss-aversion&#34;&gt;4.2 Age and loss aversion.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings in the results do, in a way, show that older people are more loss averse,
because the loss aversion coefficient found in the results do confirm the hypotheses made.
Although so, the regression results propose the contrary idea, showing a negative, and non-
significant correlation with loss aversion. This could be due to the different emphasis each
model has. Considering only on the aspect of comparing the loss aversion coefficient,
Guttman and other researchers reports that age influences loss aversion, as it is correlated
with the thickness of PCC (Posterior cingulate cortex), a brain region that controls decision
making (2021). In their study, the thickness of PCC declines with age, affecting older
people’s decision making and increasing their loss aversion (Guttman, Ghahremani, Pochon,
Dean and London, 2021). Studies confirm their hypothesis, reporting an increase of loss
aversion with the increase of age (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari, 2015). Part of the
results of this study proves their explanation. Another implied answer could be the
Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST), suggesting that people prioritize different goals
based on their perception of time (Löckenhoff, 2011). Older people with a shorter perceived
future might focus in the present, making the losses seem more impactful. They also focus on
their emotions more, meaning that the emotional impact of losses could be a devastating blow
for them than for younger people. But this explanation is a mere hypothesis, there still is a
lack of the explanation of why there are age differences in loss aversion. Some studies might
not be completely explainable for the results found in this study. Further research is required
in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;43-loss-aversion-and-others&#34;&gt;4.3 Loss aversion and others
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though age and gender and many other factors are said to affect loss aversion,
people with different emotions, personalities, growing environments could make choices
inconsistently. It is found that factors like the distribution of religion, individualism and
masculinity can all have an indifference in loss aversion between gender effect on loss
aversion (Wang, Rieger, Hens, 2016). Even after controlling variables, areas in Europe
showed more loss aversion and areas like America showed less (Wang, et al. 2016). Studies
in different geographic locations could lead to inconsistent findings. Chinese people value
collectivism more, perhaps having a cushioning effect in the society after taking risks,
decreasing their differences in loss aversion (Hsee and Weber, 1999). Americans might value
individualism more, gaining a more unique personality, leading to significant differences in
findings. Loss aversion also depends on psychological and emotional factors, and neural
studies show that emotional regulations can alter assessments and choices decisions,
impacting loss aversion (Sokol-Hessner, Camerer, Phelps, 2013). With numerous variables
impacting loss aversion, it’s hard controlling variables such as masculinity, personality and
such, perhaps leading to a small inconsistency with other studies in the final results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-conclusion&#34;&gt;5. Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses mainly on influence of age and gender on loss aversion in China. The
results show that there’s no significant relationships between age and loss aversion and
gender and loss aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-limitations&#34;&gt;5.1 Limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations in the study, one being the lack of participants. Compared
to some studies, the number of participants was enough, but there wasn’t an even amount of
distribution in age. Although the age range was wider than other studies (Arora and Kumari,
2015), the number of participants in some age ranges, elders for example, was lacking, which
might lead to not-so-representative findings. This could also lead to, as mentioned before, a
difference between the pattern and the correlation shown in the regression, since averaging
the entire group may mask each response, and a lack of data could lead to some errors. The
number of people in different provinces in China is also uneven, and since geographic factors
could affect gender differences in loss aversion (Solvic, 1987), perhaps the results in mostly
Beijing couldn’t represent the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ response is also something that could be improved. During the
experiment, a few responses weren’t logically correct, as they presented an answer of
agreeing to participate in higher levels of risk and giving up on lower levels of risk. Their
answers were then deleted and new participants were asked to do the survey. Although errors
like these were eliminated, it is hard to promise that every participant wasn’t rushing through
it. This could be due to the absence of remunerations and refreshments for participants, since
most studies had them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for more adequate word choices during the design of questionnaires could
be a problem. An inadequate design might imply demand characteristics, meaning that the
title and word choices could subconsciously alter the decisions participants make. A
phenomenon was discovered after the survey spread- a few participants claimed that they
were ‘a gambler’ (in the survey). The participants could interpret such a survey as measuring
risk attitudes, suggesting that they might have tried to incline to the gamble to fit the
perceived purpose of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-implications-and-further-research&#34;&gt;5.2 Implications and Further Research
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study still hold some questions unanswered. The analyses of the
results gave some answers but also presented some gaps. Studies could focus on the
relationship of age with risk aversion and loss aversion and the reason why they were related.
Much could be implied about the cultural difference that influences loss aversion- the results
were different in China than it was in India and the US, was it due to the cultural
environment, history it had, the economy, or the political environment? How much is gender
and age correlated with loss aversion? Is the significance of these factors larger than religious
beliefs, emotions, and wealth? The relationships between risk-taking and loss aversion—how
are they related? Does the factors that influence one subject influence another? Would the
effect be any different? To make sure results were consistent and accurate, there could be an
improvement in this study by increasing the accuracy and preciseness of survey questions,
the number of participants, and other effective variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ALEXANDER HAMILTON, the first-ever Secretary of the United States Treasury, is the musical’s protagonist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MOTHER, the mother of Hamilton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GEORGE WASHINGTON, the mentor of Hamilton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BURR, the friend and the narrator of Hamilton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELIZA, wife of Hamilton.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEFFERSON, a rival of Hamilton with opposing views.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;act-one-youth&#34;&gt;ACT ONE: YOUTH
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scene-1&#34;&gt;Scene 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Introduction, several people recite:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS ANCESTOR: (standing in the middle of the stage)
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman,
dropped in the middle of a forgotten Spot in the Caribbean
by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar? (rise arms, move to the right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS ANGELICA:
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter (move to the left)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS MADISON:
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter (stay in the middle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS MADISON:
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS ANCESTOR:
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don&amp;rsquo;t forget from whence you came, and
The world&amp;rsquo;s gonna know your name. What&amp;rsquo;s your name, man?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL: Alexander Hamilton!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background music Alexander Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scene-2&#34;&gt;Scene 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton (present) is on the cruise, reminiscing about his conversation with his mother. He stands on the deck, but his mind is pulled towards the conversation with his mother. Mother steps into the light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(gentle)&lt;/em&gt; In the candlelit shadows of my youth,
Mother’s words, a gentle breeze, whispered in my ear,
&lt;em&gt;(here mother appears)&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Son, hold fast to your dreams, let no doubt interfere.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;em&gt;(breath)&lt;/em&gt;, in New York, I can be a new man…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOTHER: &lt;em&gt;(echo like, tenderly)&lt;/em&gt; Alexander, let your spirit soar,
With resolve and courage, open every door.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(determined)&lt;/em&gt; And so I vowed, beneath the flickering flame,
To ingrain my name upon the walls of fame,
With every word I wrote, page I turned,
I knew my journey&amp;rsquo;s path, I would fiercely defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOTHER: &lt;em&gt;(gentle but firm)&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;My dear boy,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(whispered)&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;never yield,
In the face of adversity, let your spirit wield,
For greatness lies not in fortune&amp;rsquo;s hand,
But in the heart of one who dares to stand.&amp;rdquo;
I see your dreams, divine,
Which shall lead you to the stars that shine,
With every step, with every breath you take,
Let your spirit soar, let your dreams awake.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: My mother&amp;rsquo;s words, a beacon in the night,
Guided me through darkness, towards the light.
With every heartbeat, every sigh,
I vowed to reach for the endless sky,
For in the echoes of my mother&amp;rsquo;s voice,
I found the strength to make my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Alexander then stares straight ahead, his mother steps back, watching his figure tearfully)&lt;/em&gt;
MOTHER: &amp;ldquo;Alexander,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(whispered)&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;ldquo;you are my pride,
In your heart, let courage and honor abide,
For though the road may be long and steep,
Your dreams, my son, are yours to keep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scene-3&#34;&gt;Scene 3
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burr:
In early days of America, at King&amp;rsquo;s College&amp;rsquo;s gate,
Alexander Hamilton embarked on a fate.
His words like swords, sharp and clear,
Inspiring patriots, instilling fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rise up!&amp;rdquo; he cried, “No monarchy&amp;rsquo;s might!”
Kindling revolution&amp;rsquo;s fervent light.
His path was not of words alone,
In battles fierce, his courage shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through war&amp;rsquo;s dark haze, his talent soared,
Winning battles, earning accord.
Washington&amp;rsquo;s eye, keen and bright,
Saw in Hamilton a guiding light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As war’s end brought a nation&amp;rsquo;s dawn,
Washington, president, honor drawn.
A new chapter, history&amp;rsquo;s page,
Hamilton steps onto a larger stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton steps into Washington’s office, filled with books. Washington stands behind the table/ sits in the chair while Hamilton shows him his passions and dreams. Washington admires his ambition and thoughts, asking him if he’d like to be his secretary. During this talk, they are like mentor and student.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Sir, you asked to see me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: Yes. Hamilton, how come you won’t settle down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Sir?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: &lt;em&gt;(enthusiastically)&lt;/em&gt; Don’t get me wrong, Hamilton. I admire your ambition, and I see your desire for state matters. You’re so full of energy, you never seem to stop fighting for what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton smiles sheepishly at his compliment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stand here amidst the aftermath of war, I am filled with both hope and concern for our young nation. What do you envision for America&amp;rsquo;s future? What thoughts do you hold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(young and passionate)&lt;/em&gt; General, I believe America has the potential to become the beacon of liberty and prosperity for all. But to achieve this, we must prioritize economic development and international trade. We need to establish strong financial institutions and promote industrial growth to secure our place on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: &lt;em&gt;(encouragingly)&lt;/em&gt; Your ambition for America&amp;rsquo;s economic growth is admirable, Hamilton. But let us not forget the importance of unity and diplomacy in our endeavors. We must seek to mend the wounds of war and foster alliances with other nations to ensure our security and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Indeed, sir. I recognize the importance of diplomacy and cooperation in securing our nation&amp;rsquo;s future. I am committed to working tirelessly to strengthen our international relations and promote peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON:  Your dedication to our nation&amp;rsquo;s welfare is unquestionable, Hamilton. I have every confidence that you will continue to serve America with honor and distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON:  Thank you, General. It is an honor to serve alongside you in the service of our beloved country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: And speaking of service &lt;em&gt;(smiles cheekily)&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time you consider settling down and starting a family. Have you given any thought to finding a suitable partner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(laughs)&lt;/em&gt; Well, sir, I must confess I have not had much time for such matters. But if you have someone in mind, I am all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: Have you heard about the Schuyler family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Schuyler? Of course. Everyone in New York knows about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: &lt;em&gt;(laughs)&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Philip Schuyler is looking for a suitable man for his daughters. Perhaps Eliza Schuyler? I think she’ll be at the banquet. Don’t throw away your shot. &lt;em&gt;(winks)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Music appears- The Schuyler sisters, shouting Eliza) Eliza steps on stage and smiles as Hamilton. Music keeps on playing, but at a lower volume.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s a fine young woman, and I believe she would make an excellent match for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Thank you for the suggestion, sir. I will certainly keep it in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;act-two-dedication&#34;&gt;ACT TWO: DEDICATION
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BURR：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the ball,
Their feelings known by all,
Eliza and Alexander began to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ink-stain fingers, hearts aflame,
Across the miles, they wrote their names.
Hamilton’s quill, a graceful sweep,
His love for her, greater than an endless sea.
Through distance and time,
Love was hidden in each line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vows made, lives intertwined,
Newlywed couples started to dream.&lt;br&gt;
Yet duty called, the nation’s need,
Hamilton answered with fervent speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From war to peace, from sword to quill,
He crafted plans with iron will.
The economy’s fate now in his hands,
A visionary’s dream for prosperous lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With love and strength, Eliza stood by his side,
Through every storm, through every tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton set forth, with unwavering will.
Although arduous, he spoke his mind
but attracted a rival, one of a kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scene-1-1&#34;&gt;Scene 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In their house, right beside the office table, Hamilton is furiously scribbling his thoughts on the paper while his wife is persuading him to take a rest. Hamilton hasn’t slept for a day, making Eliza worried. Eliza tries to give him a break.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hamilton sits at the desk, pen and paper up, writing something)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eliza walks into the office)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: &lt;em&gt;(Walking beside him and grabbing his attention)&lt;/em&gt;
Alexander, you&amp;rsquo;ve been in here for hours. What troubles you so deeply?  Normally, you—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON：&lt;em&gt;(turns to look at Eliza)&lt;/em&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s Jefferson. He opposes every move I make, every plan I propose. His resistance is relentless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s just an obstacle on the nation’s road towards glory, I can’t even stand him! We are all valued by Washington, but I don’t get how Jefferson could come up to a position as my equal. My beliefs are better but they all can’t just see that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: &lt;em&gt;(gently)&lt;/em&gt; You&amp;rsquo;ve always known there would be opposition. But Washington chose you for a reason. He saw your brilliance, your vision for this nation. Let’s see, when were you nominated as Secretary of the United States Treasury? JUST after the war has gone, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON：&lt;em&gt;(frustrated)&lt;/em&gt; But what if I&amp;rsquo;m not the man he believes I am? What if I&amp;rsquo;m failing him, failing everyone? I, I just…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: &lt;em&gt;(firmly)&lt;/em&gt; You are not failing. You&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished so much already. Washington trusts you because he knows your capabilities. And I trust you because I see your dedication and your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(softening)&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; every step forward feels like ten steps back. I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted, Eliza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: &lt;em&gt;(concerned)&lt;/em&gt; I see the strain it&amp;rsquo;s taking on you. Your will is appreciable, but you mustn&amp;rsquo;t forget to take care of yourself. Success is meaningless if it costs you your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(looking down)&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to feel overwhelmed. Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s opposition feels like a personal attack intensely sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: Then take a break, Alexander. Clear your mind, regain your strength. Remember, Washington chose you for a reason. And I believe in you, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: &lt;em&gt;(nodding slowly)&lt;/em&gt; Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re right. Maybe I do need to step back, just for a moment. Then, I’ll be reenergized, back to fight for my country. But before this, just let me scribble a few more words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA: &lt;em&gt;(smiling)&lt;/em&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ll get through this together. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to carry the burden alone. Take a break!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: Eliza, your support means everything to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELIZA:  Always, my love. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scene-2-1&#34;&gt;Scene 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BURR:
In the height of a nation, where destinies align,
Two visions clash in the late afternoon shine.
Hamilton and Jefferson, with minds refined,
Prepare to debate, their futures intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton commands the Treasury’s might,
A strong central force guiding the night.
Banks and commerce as the nation’s core,
In his detailed plans, prosperity soars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson hears the land’s gentle plea,
A republic of farmers, where men are free.
He champions states with a vigilant cry,
For liberty in simplicity, he’ll never deny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle begins, the nation holds its breath,
Two titans prepare, in the face of the test.
Their words will resonate, the future at stake,
As they steer the course America will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton and Jefferson are at the round table, and they form a semi circle, Hamilton and Jefferson on opposing sides. They are debating. Other council members sitting beside them, listening to them debate. Burr is the narrator, he stands alone, apart from the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two men stand facing each other, voices raised in passionate debate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson:&lt;em&gt;（拍桌而起）&lt;/em&gt;
This is an outrage, Hamilton! We fought a revolution to throw off the shackles of a distant king, and now you want to burden our citizens with the debts of failed states?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton:&lt;em&gt;（intense and energetic)&lt;/em&gt;
Mr. Jefferson, with all due respect, we are not a collection of &amp;ldquo;failed states,&amp;rdquo; but a united nation! These debts were incurred to secure our collective liberty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson:
At what cost, Hamilton? By saddling future generations with the financial burdens of the past, we create a new kind of tyranny - one of debt! Where’s the“Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”we claim to chase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamilton:
A temporary burden, sir, to secure a prosperous future! A strong national credit will inspire investment and trade, the lifeblood of any economy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEFFERSON: And who benefits from this strong credit, Hamilton? This plan favors the rich at the expense of the common man, the very people who bled for our independence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON：There’s no need for the reason, a wise central place of a country IS TO MAKE THE U.S. better. Even if it means sacrificing our citizens for the government for just a short notice. And uh- you didn’t even fight in the war; why you get a say in this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEFFERSON：Strong nation or bloated government? You advocate for a powerful central authority that would crush the very spirit of liberty we fought for! Who knows how long this oppression with last?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: A mighty order is necessary, Mr. Jefferson! Without a central government to manage our finances and foster trade, we risk becoming nothing more than squabbling colonies once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEFFERSON：This is RIDICULOUS. Look at your fake face, calling out for liberty but unable to achieve such in the end. I’ll do what citizens want, BY MYSELF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAMILTON: You’re stupid believes are useless, sitting there with Maddison as two shits! You claim to the patriotic but you’re not. Turn around, bend over, I show you where my shoe fits-
&lt;em&gt;(Washington pulls the two brawling people aside. The three leaves)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ending&#34;&gt;ENDING
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burr and Hamilton闪亮登场 开始决斗 俩人拿把模型枪&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton 举枪沉默，放一张PPT，黑底白字，那句“我已经虔诚地忏悔，并愿意与所有的人和解，包括伯尔。”“I have repented devoutly and am willing to reconcile with all, including Burr.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;然后放下枪&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;反观BURR 直接一枪击毙&amp;quot;Your deeds will be remembered for generations to come.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*(Hamilton is swarmed with people, and the actors now usher him off stage. Burr stands aside, startled and confused.) *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;切歌&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The story of tonight”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington&amp;amp; Burr: &lt;em&gt;I may not live to see our glory!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington&amp;amp; Burr: &lt;em&gt;I may not live to see our glory!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson&amp;amp; Madison: &lt;em&gt;But I will gladly join the fight!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson&amp;amp; Madison: &lt;em&gt;But I will gladly join the fight!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliza&amp;amp; Angelica: &lt;em&gt;And when our children tell our story…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliza&amp;amp; Angelica: &lt;em&gt;And when our children tell our story…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: &lt;em&gt;They’ll tell the story of tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All: &lt;em&gt;Let’s have another round tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All: &lt;em&gt;Let’s have another round tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All: &lt;em&gt;Let’s have another round tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington: &lt;em&gt;Raise a glass to freedom,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burr: &lt;em&gt;Something they can never take away,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother: &lt;em&gt;No matter what they tell you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madison: &lt;em&gt;Raise a glass to the four of us,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jefferson: &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow there’ll be more of us,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelica: &lt;em&gt;Telling the story of tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliza: &lt;em&gt;They’ll tell the story of tonight,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REPEAT (All actors on stage now)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raise a glass to freedom,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something they can never take away,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No matter what they tell you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Catching Butterflies</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/catching-butterflies/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/catching-butterflies/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Butterflies. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear it? It could be the butterfly fluttering in the meadow. But for me, it is the butterflies flying in my stomach. So now you might understand why this x-ray picture with butterflies is doing here. This, quite literally, is just having butterflies in your stomach. So why is it here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just begin with telling you what having ‘butterflies in your stomach’ means. This describes the nervous energy in your belly before or during situations where you might feel anxious or excited. I hate this feeling, but you see me standing here, which means I have caught some of them (grabs some of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My middle school speech competition was still carved in my mind. I wrote my draft and learnt it by heart. While drawing the lot deciding who would go first, I came in second. Standing on the stage, looking at the referees while the coloured lights shone on my face, I could only hear my pounding heart and my brain who ushered me to say something. I couldn’t remember how I finished, though. I said whatever that immediately came to mind, and stammered my whole way through it. My head was hanging so low when I walked back to class, and I just couldn’t bear to think how I disappointed my teachers, classmates. They still cheered for me though, I was just being paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think— why do I have butterflies in my stomach? Why could the others say and act out everything so confidently while I kept on stammering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I look down from the stage, the pitch-black audience, I’d feel scared. Why? Well, I was near-sighted, so whenever I take off my glasses, I couldn’t see everyone’s expressions clearly, only a blurred outline. It might be my own mind, but the audiences’ faces seemed to transform into devilish grinning faces, waiting for me to make a joke of myself and laugh in my face after failure. My mind seemed to be surrounded with laughter, mockery, making my whole head blank and filled with worriedness. My true words were supressed and buried, and everything I said sounded so silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly can we get over stage fright and improve our confidence? That is a good question. I’m curious too, and to be honest, I don’t think that I have the exact answer. But I’d like to share my thoughts and hope you’d get inspired. There was this time when I had to speak in front of the class, and I was frightened. In my perspective, I did poorly. I was stammering, afraid to make eye contact and I kept forgetting my words, improvising as I went along. When I asked my friends how I did, they said I did well. I asked “I felt so nervous up there, couldn’t you feel it?” But they responded “you seemed so confident up there. You did great!” I gaped at their words. Were my wobbly legs, sweaty hands and pounding heart all an illusion? That’s when I realized it. It wasn’t. I felt it, real and true, but it wasn’t apparent in other people’s perspectives. Perhaps we’re all making a big deal of ourselves, especially the way we look in other people’s eyes. Was it, was it even possible in the slightest way that other contestants are just as awkward and nervous as me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was this scared, why would I go on stage and give a speech? Perhaps this was just a ritual of saying goodbye to the old, scared me. Perhaps I still haven’t got over stage fright, but, hey, at least I took a step forward. Awkward as it is, I finally managed to speak my thoughts out to all of you, and that’s enough. Could I regret this? I might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever we choose we are held responsible for it. No matter what the difficulty is, just brave it out and you’ll manage. The butterflies still appear in my stomach whenever I do something that gets me nervous, but I’m going to catch it, even if it means I have to do things I shrink from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ender’s Game movie review</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/enders-game-movie-review/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/enders-game-movie-review/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was scrolling through movies, I came across Ender’s game. I haven’t read the book before, so my reviews are only on the movie and some comments and reviews others had on the book. The movie was about people training an army used to fight the Formics (sort of like ants), and Ender was the main character who’s destined to lead the team into winning the war. Personally, I believe that it was a good movie, although there were parts that I was confused with or could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote at the start of the movie provided me a new perspective on our relationship with others. When you fight your enemy, you do everything to understand them in order to win them. I guess that’s why people say the feeling hate lasts longer than love? Only if you hate somebody do you consider them as your enemy, and in order to win your enemy, you learn everything, from their names to their favourite song they’d like to hear when they get sad. When you learn their beliefs, you acknowledge them as a person, as an independent person shaped by their own experiences, modelled by their faith and values.  I guess this quote also foreshadows what happened later in the movie, as when Ender is trained to fight more and more he starts wondering about the Formics. He wonders whether they could talk, communicate, or hold values similar to people on the earth. After the final battle, when he realizes that he has wiped out the entire species, he realizes his mistake. He sees himself as a killer, a merciless weapon only trained for war without actually wondering what the Formics want. In the end, he takes the eggs (ones that survived) always on his fleet, in search of a suitable planet for raising them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great movie, especially the part where the teams battled against each other was exhilarating to watch. However, Ender seemed to much of a ‘chosen one’. To be honest, I’m pretty tired of the plot where the whole planet believes in the fact that the chosen one, the protagonist, is capable of saving them and their whole life depends on him/her. It makes the character seem more or less bland, as the something special they have makes them successful at almost everything, lacking development and growth. Ender has a development, but I just don’t think that it was really large. Growing up, Ender has felt pressure and tried to achieve as much as he can in order to make his family proud. His brother, Peter has been removed out of school for being violent, and his sister, Valentine was too compassionate to go into battle school. Growing up as a third child, he had the violence of his brother but was also compassionate. As his personality had a mix of both, I don’t really think that there was much of a character development, as his acts for example, staying with the commander picking on him or helping the Formic eggs find a new home seem reasonable enough. I saw the pressure he faced but I don’t think I get why he felt pressured (expect he had great responsibility), so I think a highlight of the psychological conflicts he faced would probably suit me better. The characters didn’t really resonate with me, which could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed heavy when the strategoes (or whatever they’re called) more or less made Ender responsible for the mistake of genocide (even though they might not believe that it was a mistake). It also felt like a blow witnessing the death of the Formics, even if they were our enemies. Although I was confused with the relationship between people on Earth and the Formics, because it seemed like people on earth demanded revenge or safety but then we discovered that they never meant harm?  Then why did the Formics attack in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the setting of this story, but I do think there could be more clarifications on some parts of the movie, which I do think that it would be better if I read the book. Although so, some say that the book wasn’t that well, so I guess I should find out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beauty of Books</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/beauty-of-books/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/beauty-of-books/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of unique topics, so I’m going to start with something common &amp;ndash; books. No matter text books we use for class, books we read outside of school for research, novels for relaxing… Books are woven into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the first time you read a book? I couldn’t. But that feeling was something I’d always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn’t take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. Books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Just like what Emily Dickinson said, “There is no Frigate like a Book; To take us Lands away”. Reading the books, I’ve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings. So much is said about fiction books, so some of you might wonder, what about nonfiction books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. If fiction books are exciting escapes, then non-fiction books are gateways to knowledge. Although I’m not a big fan of non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&amp;rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. I’ve heard an interesting book mentioned before by a college student. What was different from other books was that the author invited readers to challenge his thoughts and give out their own explanations, encouraging them to think. The whole books sounds interesting and I would’ve read it if I were better at physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read anything. But read it with a different mindset. I don’t think that a lot of us like the books we are told to read by mandarin teachers, especially for tests. There was once when we were supposed to read How the Steel was Tempered. I didn’t want to read it. But I got bored one day, so I just took a peek into that book. Okay. I was surprised. The content was completely different from what I thought it was. I actually loved the plot and was amazed at the contributions they did to the revolution. Home Letters by Fu Lei was another book required to read. But I hated it. I didn’t like how Fu Lei lectured his son, looking all saint and great. It’s alright. I didn’t stop read books after this though. I approached books next with a different mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is also a way of making us look at the bigger world out there, communicating thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or even novels can give readers an inside peek of the authors’ wise brain, learning about their encounters, and reflecting such to the world out there. In Educated, I was there, with Westover, watching her grow up. I saw her change from being oppressed by her family issues to a striving girl and graduating from well-known colleges. She changed for the better. But this made me think: how many children are stuck in the mountains, with their family, like her, unable to receive proper education, never able to walk outside, in the city and look at the world? Tara Westover was just one of them, speaking out for the thousands of people like her. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse through the main character sinclair. I saw him during times of confusion, his dirty moves but also his inner struggle, desperate for help. Immediately, I thought of me, trying my best to keep my head above water, walking in the mist, unable to find the path forward. How many of us feels like this? Confused, desperate to find that beacon leading to success. Grab a book, and you’d be surprised at the themes authors speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Herman Hesse, “the more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness — at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.” Books are so much more than what I just mentioned above. They are the crystallization of the world of thoughts, knowledge, of humanity of literally everything you can think of. It’s amazing how much things can be put in one book waiting for us to devour. But of course, my thoughts don’t represent the thoughts of everyone. So why not start reading yourself? Don’t hesitate! Start flipping through the pages, skimming briefly at the content. Anytime, anywhere, read and discover the beauty within. You’d definitely find something valuable and unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Line of passion</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/line-of-passion/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/line-of-passion/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to start with something common in our lives—books. I don’t know if you could remember properly the first time when you started reading a book. I couldn’t. But that feeling was something I’d always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn’t take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. I don’t understand passion or love that clearly, but books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Reading the books, I’ve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But books are more than just exciting escapes. They&amp;rsquo;re also gateways to knowledge. Although I’m not a big fan of scientific non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&amp;rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. Books on self-control and self-determination has helped me better acknowledge the ways of improving my time management and organization ability. Books on animals and humans taught me more about the development and history, allowing me to acquire more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is also a way of communicating thoughts. Reading different books can give us insight to different opinions and thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or just novels can all give readers an inside peek of the authors’ brain, understanding the wisdom of humans. The books I read by Tara Westover and Hermann Hesse were imprinted into my brains. In Educated, I read about the problems and obstacles Westover encountered, I understood her thoughts. I saw her actions when facing violence, facing estrangement and unacceptance; I learned her thoughts when finding out being accepted into colleges, when she finally learned to deal with her family problems. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse. I saw his character, his philosophical theories, and he had an immediate attraction on me. Through him, I started reading and trying more books he wrote, and loved his philosophical and inspiring expressions. The process of reading each book can not only show me the writing styles of authors for me to learn, but it can also reflect their own thoughts that are inspiring to me.
Reading helps. Maybe you’re anxious, maybe you’re unsure of what to do, maybe you feel overwhelmed, or maybe you’re just bored. If so, why not take a chance at reading a book? It can be a great way to relax, filling your mind with wonder and exciting information. Sometimes, diving into a good story can take our minds off our daily troubles and transport us to a different place. Reading might seem not so effective when just starting, but after doing so a long time and looking back, I find it effective in improving my English skills. Nor would it seem fun, but I find enjoyment through the pleasures of reading novels and coming to understand and communicate the symbols and the author’s true purpose with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Herman Hesse, “the more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness — at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.” Flipping through the pages and just skimming briefly the content can take you into a new world filled with thoughts of the author, so why not grab a book beside you and give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-abstract&#34;&gt;1. Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the long river of human history, humans and pets are inseparable. Pets are
treasured due to the joy they’ve brought owners and the companionship it brings, cre-
ating loving memories. The pet market has risen in the few years, especially during the
COVID, when the number of pet owners surged. At the same time, however, more and
more pets are getting abandoned, ending up stray and overcrowding the shelters, creat-
ing a big burden. People have long been confused of who’s suitable for raising pets, and
concerns have been increasing everywhere. To handle this situation, this article will ex-
plore a decision evaluating model that help determine what households are suitable for
owning a pet and forecasts future pet ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In question one, the research team identified the subjective and objective factors, which
are age, time commitment, annual salary, education level and level of demand that deter-
mines whether a household is suitable for owning a cat. The team first used Topsis and
Entropy methods to obtain the indicators. After that, we decided to use Decision Tree
and Grey Correlation methods to calculate the weights and determine the scores. The re-
sults showed that total annual income and their free time (time commitment) were more
important for whether a household could afford to own a cat. The team then found repre-
sentative countries, India, America and China, their scores and the number of households
that currently have cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second question, the team found four other species, birds, fish, large mammals,
and reptiles, and re-used the model from the first question to find the weights of the
factors. The team also used the households from Question 1A and calculated scores for
each to see which households were prepared for each pet species. For Question 2b, the
team considered using two formulas based on whether different pets could be co-owned,
raising the household score if the pets were allies and lowering the household score if the
pets were competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third question, the team solved for the different indicators by using time series
method, moving average method, to find out the value of the rate of change of each
indicator in the three geographic regions in the next 15 years. The 5, 10, and 15 years of
data for each indicator were brought into the model for the second question to find the
ownership and retention rate. The results showed that people will have more pets, and
that the problem of pet abandonment will get worse if it is not controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the team did was use multiple models. The different models can testify and
coordinate with each other, achieving the most systematic and comprehensive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Pet raising, Topsis, Entropy method, Decision Tree, Grey Correlation, ARIMA,
Time series, Moving average method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-letter-of-recommendation&#34;&gt;2. Letter of Recommendation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear directors of IMMC-A,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, and thank you for taking your time looking at our model. We are Team 24397795.
Considering your problem and concerns for stray pets and crowded animal shelters,
our model explores the preparedness of households owning pets and the future of pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create our model, the team decided subjective and objective factors of a household,
such as their annual salary, time commitment, level of demand and others. By using the
model and applying it in different types of households obtained from our questionnaires,
we concluded characteristics of households that are suitable for raising pets and not suit-
able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of households that are suitable for pets are households with enough
money, enough time and has a high level of demand. They should also be patient with
pets, kind to them, and they should be willing to learn how to care for pets. They should
also prepare future plans for pets, or a least make sure no obstacles would make them
abandon their pets. These could all make sure that the pets are living happily in the
household with enough care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characteristics that are not suitable for having pets are for example, unstable emo-
tions, anger issues, not willing to learn or care for cats, low time commitment, severe
allergies, low wages and are not able/willing to afford veterinary care. These could lead
to abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have second thoughts when seeing people with pregnancies and people
with family members who oppose of raising pets. They could have problems with pets,
which might lead to abandonment or giving away pets. They could end up in a home
happily or roam in the streets based on the attitudes of the owners, making it crucial to
confirm that the pets are with the right owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can surely believe our model since we’ve assessed a number households and
picked out the common features of good households and bad households. We’ve also
used the model on a broader scale, assessing the number of families in countries that are
prepared to raise cats, and used it with different types of species and multiple pets with
in one household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our model do posses space for improvement, but we’ve made sure that it’s still usable
for every situation. We’re still improving our model, and will give the latest version to
you whenever we’ve made changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and hope you have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team 24397795&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-introduction&#34;&gt;3 Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-background&#34;&gt;3.1 Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pets are non-endangered animals that are required by people who do not need them
for occupational purposes. Known as companion animals, pets have been around with
humans for centuries, offering a sense of purpose, stress relief, or company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During COVID, with a number of people desperate for company, the numbers of pet
owners surged. According to BBC, around 3.2 million households acquired new pets. But
with the rise of the pet market, a new problem floats above the surface. Pets are reported
to be returned back to the shelters that scaled back their operations ever since the COVID
hit (Bartiromo, 2022), leading to more and more abandoned pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect the well-being of the animals and reduce the number of stray and aban-
doned pets, it is crucial to make sure that they end up at the right place with the right
people. In this case, perhaps a model is needed to help the pets find their right owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-restating-and-analyzing-the-question&#34;&gt;3.2 Restating and Analyzing The Question.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1:&lt;/strong&gt; In order to reduce the numbers of abandoned pets, the organization, IMMC-
A requires the team to first, create a model that determines whether a household is suit-
able for raising a pet. In 1b, the team is required to assess the model on a broader scale,
determining the number of households suitable to raise pets in three countries or regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Second, the team should generalize the model by using it for four types
of other animals in six households located in the same region as mentioned in the first
question. The team should also check how the model works when facing the situation
with multiple pets. For 2b, the team considered using two formulas to raise the scores of
the households if the pets were allies, or to lower the scores if they were competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Lastly, the question asks the team to consider the retention and pet ownership
to calculate their potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question requires the team to build a decision model, to determine whether each
household is suitable for raising a pet, and to predict the the rends of the retention rate
and potential pet ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33-assumptions-for-the-model&#34;&gt;3.3 Assumptions for the Model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the household is already raising a pet, the household’s income, time, and other
indicators are subtracted from the resources taken up by having an existing pet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data the team collected is stable in the long-term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Families raising different pets in the household can have competitive or co-operative
relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The questionnaires were filled precisely by people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The indicators of each country/region has a trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-creation-of-the-model&#34;&gt;4 Creation of the Model
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-choosing-and-determining-indicators&#34;&gt;4.1 Choosing and Determining Indicators
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team decided to split the factors into subjective factors and objective factors. Then
we refined our first indicators and split them into secondary indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;411-objective-factors&#34;&gt;4.1.1 Objective Factors
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the team considered the wages of the households. Pets could only be raised
properly if given enough food, a good environment and others, which could highly in-
crease the financial burden of the household if they have low wages. This is then refined
into the residential area, degree of health, and the percentage of salary that are spent on
pets. Studies have shown that people with higher wages are more likely to live a healthier
lifestyle, and acquire larger residential area. Depending on the percentage of salary spent
on pets could also determine the financial burden of the households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, free time/time commitment is also considered (free time is considered as the
time available when households are not working, sleeping in one day). There should be
enough time for households to ensure that the cat is fed, showered, and happy. At the
same time, the elasticity of the job is considered as well, since there could be night shifts,
working overtime that could affect the free time. Not only so, the willingness to raise pets
are also taken into consideration. Households are not suitable for having pets if people
have them and the time to take care of them when they dont to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the education level of households. This could be further elaborated and ex-
plained by the educational resources they could obtain and their knowledge of cats. Their
willingness to learn is also an important aspect, since these indicators would all decide
whether youre raising a cat scientifically or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes their age. Studies have also shown that pets, especially cats are popu-
lar among young people. This could be elaborated into whether theres children or seniors
in the house, since having young aged children or seniors in the household could increase
the burden of the family; the long-term plans of the future household, to see if the pets
are able to stay long enough in the household. As the picture mentioned in figure 2, 30-
years old would be the prime age for having pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use first indicators, since its based on known facts, various studies, sur-
veys that shows a direct correlation between secondary indicators and first indicators.
The team then directly turns secondary indicators into level one indicators, saving time
and making it user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;412-subjective-factors&#34;&gt;4.1.2 Subjective Factors.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of demand for cats should regarded as an indicator, expanding this into
their emotional stability: they have to be patient, reliable, since sometimes cats could get&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on peoples nerves; allergies, since allergies could cause uncomfortable symptoms, and
if worse, death; support from nearby family and friends, since there could be negative
voices discouraging households the thought of raising a pet; if they like cats or not, be-
cause raising cats require a strenuous amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These secondary indicators could be analyzed using entropy scoring methods to quan-
tify the level of uncertainty or randomness in the demand patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-model-of-households-for-cats&#34;&gt;5 Model of Households for Cats
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-the-model-of-decision-tree-and-grey-correlation&#34;&gt;5.1 The Model of Decision Tree and Grey Correlation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this question, the team collected data from 100 different families in the form of ques-
tionnaires on the indicators mentioned above. The data were categorized into objective
factual data and subjective judgmental data. Objective indicators and subjective indica-
tors were asked in the form of scale questions. After obtaining the questionnaires and
screening out the not valid ones, the group quantified the objective data on a scale of 1-
in order to eliminate the influence of different aspects on the evaluation results. Finally,
the team used SPSS software for modelling and solving the problem, and drew conclu-
sions by combining two correlation analysis models: decision tree and grey correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision tree is a predictive analytic model expressed as a tree structure (including
binary and multinomial trees), which represents a mapping relationship between object
attributes and object values. Each node in the tree represents an object, while each forked
path represents a possible attribute value, and each leaf node corresponds to the value of
the object represented by the path from the root node to the leaf node.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision tree algorithm is introduced in this study to facilitate the understand-
ing and interpretation of the conclusions; to analyze nonlinear relational data in a more
direct and efficient way; and to be suitable for complex problem solving. The decision
tree is constructed based on entropy increment of information entropy, and the specific
information entropy and entropy increment formulas are uses the function:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
H(x) \, \triangleq \, \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i(x) \log_2 p_i(x)
$$$$
\text{Gini}(D^K) = \sum_{k}^{K} p_k (1 - p_k) = \sum_{k}^{K} p_k - \sum_{k}^{K} p_k^2 = 1 - \sum_{k}^{K} p_k^2
$$&lt;p&gt;This is also used to perform feature selection through information gain. The decision
tree is divided based on information gain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called information gain is the information gain g(D,A) of feature A on the train-
ing dataset D is defined as the difference between the information entropy H(D) of the set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D and the information conditional entropy H(D|A) of D under the given conditions of
feature A:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
g(D, A) =H(D)−H(D|A)
$$&lt;p&gt;Grey correlation analysis model is introduced in this study to find the indicator that is
the most relatable. The dependent variable, Y in the parent sequence is known as whether
to raise pets or not, while X in the sub-sequence is known as the function below, with m
as the five indicators and n as the data from 100 questionnaires:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
Y = [y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m]
$$$$
X_{nm} = \begin{bmatrix}
X_{11} &amp; X_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; X_{1m} \\
X_{21} &amp; X_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; X_{2m} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
X_{n1} &amp; X_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; X_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
$$&lt;p&gt;Since the values of the scale questions are 1-5 and on the same magnitude, thus no
normalization is required. The team then calculates the correlation coefficient of each
indicators with the parent sequences and the sub-sequences, and uses the function below:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
a = min_{i} max_{k} |x_0(k) - x_i(k)|
$$$$
b = max_{i} max_{k} |x_0(k) - x_i(k)|
$$&lt;p&gt;This shows the bipolar maximum and minimum differences. Then, for finding Z, the
team uses the function:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
z_{k,j} = \xi_{j}(k) = \frac{a + \rho b}{|x_{k,j} - y_{j} + \rho b|}
$$&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the team calculates the relatedness of the indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/p/immc-international-2024-assessing-family-pet-ownership-based-on-multi-model-correlation-analysis/04.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;1501px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model used in this study is intuitive, since the tree-like structure generated by the
decision tree is logical and clear; the grey correlation analysis straightforwardly displays
the correlation ranking of the indicators, which helps focusing on the factors that have
the greatest impact on whether or not to own a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

weights of the subjective secondary indicators. In this way, the team can translate the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She can also provide interaction and care for the cat, feeding it regularly and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Married Couple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Salary: Retirement income of around $48,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment: High; home most of the day and can provide constant compan-
ionship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age: Around 32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Level: Bachelors degree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of Demand: Medium to high demand for wanting companionship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 3.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retired couple is a good household because it provides enough time for caring for
pets, a stable environment, and enough money to afford the expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Family with Child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Salary: $120,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment: Depends, both parents work, but children are home earlier and
can play with and care for the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age: Parents around 55 years, child 25 years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Level: Bachelors degree, Undergraduate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of Demand: high, the child love cats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 3.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The income ensures financial stability for health care, nutrition, toys and others, chil-
dren can also provide enough time for care and companionship. Though the emotional
stability might not be as high, the fondness for cats is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Busy Single Professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Salary: $78,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment: Very low; frequently travels for work and often stays late at the
office doing studies and writing essays&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age: 60&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Level: Master’s Degree
Level of Demand: Medium to low, since hes too busy to care for cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 2.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hes financially stable, a lack of time commitment for cats could make him
neglect the needs of the cat such as attention, necessary care and companionship, making
the environment unsuitable for the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The High School Student with A Single Parent that Only Gives Him Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Salary: $30000, all of these money are from his mother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment: Low; busy with classes, studying, and social activities. Housing
restricts pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age: 15
Education Level: High School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of Demand: Medium to high; looking for a companion animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low financial stability might not make the person able to afford the costs of raising a
cat. Pursuing studies and a not so flexible schedule could lead to low time commitment
and an unstable environment for cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The Family with Severe Allergies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Salary: $88,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Commitment: low, since the parents are usually at work and the children are
busy studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age: Parents are around 50, one child is mostly in college while the other is in high
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education Level: Parents graduated from community college; the children go to nice
schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of Demand: Especially low for cats since allergies. Quite low for other pets as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Score: 1.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a suitable income and time commitment, severe allergies to cat dander
in one or more family members make a household environment hostile to cats. Health
risks associated with allergic reactions, including asthma or severe allergic reactions are
detrimental to owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-model-usage-in-different-countries&#34;&gt;5.2 Model Usage in Different Countries
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this question, the team chose 8 representative countries, Finland, Japan, Iceland,
UK, Mexico, Pakistan, Kenya, and United Arabs Emirates. According to the objective
factors, the team found their average annual salary, average working time, percentage of
people’s access to higher education, median age, and their happiness index. After finding
these data, the team normalized these and calculated their total score. By using the scores
as the horizontal co-ordinate and the number of households with cats as the vertical co-
ordinate, the team fit data into a graph and found the function, in figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph plotted had the function:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
F(x) = p_1 x^3 + p_2 x^2 + p_3 x + p_4
$$&lt;p&gt;The team chose China, India, and America as the three countries to calculate the number
of households that are prepared to raise cats. The team found the value of each indicator
and calculated their scores, which are 0.53, 0.13 and 0.84. Then according to the function,
the graph had values with the percentage 26.4%, 20.4%, and 14%. The team then multi-
plied the percentage with the household numbers. For America, there are (131.43million
times 14%) around 18.4 million households are having cats as pets. In china, (494.16 mil-
lion times 26.4%), around 130 million households that raise pets, while in India, there are
(302 million times 20.4%) around 61.6 million households raising pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;61-usage-for-different-pets&#34;&gt;6.1 Usage for Different Pets
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the model created in 1A is general and able to be used in every condition, the
team re-used the model. According to the classification of animals, the team decided to
split the pets into five different categories, small-medium sized mammals, large mam-
mals, reptiles, birds and fish. The team then picked the most representative pet in the
category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Birds&lt;/strong&gt; Birds are a wide category since around 6.1 million households own pets
(safe worldwide), making it a universalized pet. But to make it more specific, the team
narrowed it down into a representative: The crested myna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fish&lt;/strong&gt; Fishes are easy to raise, has a low cost, making everyone want them as pets.
Especially goldfish, which are seen commonly in every household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Llama&lt;/strong&gt; In large mammals, llamas are popular as companion pets. Although the
numbers of llamas are not calculated, they are raised as pets known for their gentle, calm
nature. They also require less intensive care than cows and adapt well to environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Snake&lt;/strong&gt; Snakes are considered as popular pets. Nowadays more and more people
online are raising snakes as pet, since they use low costs and are easy to raise.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the given figure (2) of the decision tree, the team summed up the factors
that affects the standards of the household. For snakes, the education level is the highest,
and commitment time is the lowest; while for llamas, the commitment time is the highest,
and education levels are the least important factor. Fishes are raised according to the level
of demand, while needing lower time commitment and age. Birds also require a high level
of demand, but low levels of education and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used the households mentioned in 1A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household A, the professor would be suitable for almost any animal, since every
factor is appropriate for having a pet. But to find out which pet she is most prepared for&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would depend on her level of demands. The scores of birds are 3.2, higher than llamas,
3.1, but not as high enough as fish, 3.3. The highest would be having a snake, which is 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household B, the couple are prepared for every animal, since they have suitable
conditions for raising a pet. Cats, fish, and the score for snakes are all high, ranging from
3.7 to 3.9. But the highest of the all would be the llama and the crested myna, with the
score of 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household C, with their enthusiasm and high level of demand, they are prepared
for every pet. Their high scores for every pet, 4 for crested myna; 4.1 for llama and snakes,
and 4.2, highest for fishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household D, the professor would not be prepared for any pet, due to low demand
and little time commitment. The scores are all around 2, ranging from 2 to 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household E, this household isnt prepared to raise almost every pet. Low income,
little time, and With scores of 2.1, 2, 2.3, they all fall below the appropriate score for raising
pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For household F, although allergic to cats, they might not be suitable to raise other
pets. Their scores, around 2.2, 1.9 and 2.4 are all below the score suitable for raising pets,
making this household not suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;62-usage-for-different-pets-in-the-same-household&#34;&gt;6.2 Usage for Different Pets in the Same Household
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this question, the team considered the relationship of the pets in the same house-
hold. There are two relations: competitors and allies. The team first calculated the scores
of the pets. By using figure 7, the team came up with the relationships of the pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pets that are competitors, such as birds and cats (cats might eat birds), would not be
suitable to be raised in the same household. So the team used the function&lt;/p&gt;
$$
S = \frac{\min(S_i)}{1 + e^{-\max(S_i)}}
$$&lt;p&gt;to find the out the score of the household. For this household, the team found out the
minimum of the score and divided it by e, with S as the score and i as the number of pets.&lt;/p&gt;
$$
S = \max(S_i) ⋅ (1 + e^{-\min(S_i)})
$$&lt;p&gt;For pets that are allies, such as llamas and fish, the team uses the maximum of the
score and multiplies it by e, with S as the score and i as the number of pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-the-model-in-the-future&#34;&gt;7 The Model in the Future
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this question, the team used theARIMAmodel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team created aAR, the auto regression model, for predicting education levels,
work hours and income. TheARmodel describes the relationship between current and
historical values, using the variable’s own historical time data to make predictions about
itself, using the function:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
X_t = \alpha_1 X_{t-1} + \alpha_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \alpha_p X_{t-p} + u_t
$$&lt;p&gt;WhereXiis the predicting value of the i year,a 1 is the coefficient that effectsX 1 .a 1 in
this article is the composite weigh of the factors concluded by the decision tree and grey
correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the multiple factors being influenced by many social factors, there is a slight
volatility in the changes in the values. So we introduced the term ’white term’ as an
important factor in the AR model, with the function:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
u_t = \varepsilon_t
$$&lt;p&gt;The function would be a pureARprocess:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
X_t = \alpha_1 X_{t-1} + \alpha_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \alpha_p X_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t
$$&lt;p&gt;In theARmodel,if it’s not a ’white noise’, it is usually considered to be a q-order
moving average. That is:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
u_t = \varepsilon_t + \beta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \beta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}
$$&lt;p&gt;Considering education level, work hours and income factors has a relatively smooth
trend, the team decided to use this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the team considered their age and happiness. The three countries chosen
in this text has a stable public welfare and is not so related to the historical value. AR
cannot predict those, so the team decided to useMA, when the current values of the time
series are not related to the historical values, but depend only on a linear combination of
historical white terms. TheMAmodel is obtained as:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
X_t = \alpha_1 X_{t-1} + \alpha_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \alpha_p X_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t + \beta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \beta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}
$$&lt;p&gt;After calculation, the team found out the scores of the three indicators of each country.
Then, our team multiplied the scores with the weight of the indicators, finding out the
total score of the country in five, ten, and fifteen years. The team then put the scores into
the function mentioned in 1b, calculating the number of households that are prepared to
raise pets.&lt;/p&gt;

$$
K = \begin{cases} 
\frac{k_{\text{predict}}}{k_{\text{now}}} \times 100\% &amp; k_{\text{predict}} &lt; k_{\text{now}} \\ 
100\% &amp; k_{\text{predict}} \geq k_{\text{now}} 
\end{cases}
$$&lt;p&gt;After comparing the number of households that are suitable to raise pets in each coun-
try, the team calculated the retention rate of pets using the function above. An example
of the retention rate in the country China is in figure 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph shown above tells the retention rate and pet ownership rates. We can see
that the mynas and corn snakes, which are influenced by the age indicator, are likely to
be abandoned due to aging of the population. In China, the problem of aging have made
the abandonment rate of corn snakes relatively high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in India, due to a lower happiness indicator, the level of demand decreases,
leading to high abandonment rates for llamas, mynas, and corn snakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team decided to use the decision tree algorithm, which is more intuitive and
efficient to analyze nonlinear relational data, suitable for complex problem solving, and
can feature selection through information gain. The study also uses the grey correlation
analysis model to find the indicator of maximum correlation. The gray correlation anal-
ysis model is able to provide reliable results despite the small number of samples and is
insensitive to the data, effectively overcoming the uncertainty of the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team used the time series ARIMA model to predict the values of the indicators.
The model requires only endogenous variables without the use of other exogenous vari-
ables; it can effectively and accurately predict variables that change over time; it is prac-
tical, can be highly generalized, and can be applied to other models with time-periodic
variations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;82-weaknesses-of-the-model&#34;&gt;8.2 Weaknesses of The Model
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some algorithms have high requirements for data accuracy. For example, the deci-
sion tree model has strict requirements on the accuracy and quality of input and output
data; is more sensitive to data and is susceptible to disrupting data. When dealing with
unbalanced datasets, the decision tree model may tend to favor the dominant one, requir-
ing attention of the stability of the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although gray correlation analysis reveals the relationship between indicators, it
cannot provide a cause and effect explanation. Therefore, the decision tree model was
used in this study to show the visualization of the decision-making process to help with
understanding and drawing conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time series ARIMA model has a more complex calculation process with more
steps; it requires that the time series data must be stable, or else differential processing
is needed. Also, the model can essentially only capture linear relationships, which is
suitable for forecasting with linearly varying data, but cannot capture nonlinear relation-
ships.&lt;/li&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/%E8%9B%A4%E8%9F%86%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F%E5%8E%BB%E7%9C%8B%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E5%8C%BB%E7%94%9F/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;故事的开始，蛤蟆先生抑郁了。他开始酗酒，失眠，变得十分邋遢。于是他的朋友们将他带到了心理医生那里去咨询。与苍鹭先生初次相识，他十分抑郁，给他自己的状态打了两分。但通过一次又一次与苍鹭的讨论，蛤蟆感悟到了自己为什么成为了自己的原因，变得活力满满。不仅如此，他也带领着我一起成长，解了到了我们的不同状态，人生中的不同坐标，增强了对自己的认识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最初，蛤蟆先生与苍鹭探索了他幼时抑郁的原因。父母给出的无从压力，发泄出口的缺失，以及现在部分朋友对他的态度都令他感到悲伤。此处，苍鹭引入了儿童自我状态 （Child ego state） 的概念（所谓某些人做出的反应与小时候的行动方式，感受相同），又将此分为了自然型儿童和适应型儿童。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自然型儿童拥有着基本的情绪状态，如快乐、深情、愤怒、悲伤、恐惧。而适应型儿童会顺从，依赖，道歉，适应当下的环境，进入自我保护状态。蛤蟆通过访谈发现他很少发脾气。与其说怒气冲冲的将人骂一顿火撒泼打滚，如图，迫于原生家庭的压力，他可能将此转化为郁闷，怄气，使他一直处于一种弱势群体的状态。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;咨询中，蛤蟆也提到过他的老朋友，獾。獾打算竞选入校董会，并严厉的要求蛤蟆交上辞职信。对此，蛤蟆十分生气，不仅对獾生气，同时也对他自己的不争气的生气。与苍鹭的谈话中，他发现，獾的表现如同他严厉的父母一样，进入了父母自我状态，十分的挑剔，成为了挑剔性父母，通常会很严厉，愤怒，并且爱挑剔对方。同时，苍鹭也提到了蛤蟆的状态-处于父母自我状态下的他，并不会去批判其他人，但会进行自我批判；这也使苍鹭提到了一个游戏-poor little old me，提出了对于游戏的输赢都取决于玩家的看法，提出了蛤蟆可能在‘共谋’，在暗处导致自己的行为向结果偏向。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后一个状态，成人自我状态 Adult ego state。苍鹭对蛤蟆说“ 在这个状态下，我们能计划、考虑、决定、行动，我们能理性而合理地行事。处于这个状态时，我们所有的知识和技能都能为自己所用，而不再被脑子里父母过去的声音所驱使，也不会被童年的情绪所围困。相反，我们能思考当下的状况，基于事实来决定要怎么做。”  在大部分人眼中，我相信这个是最佳的状态，但这个状态取决于自己是否能让自己达到这个状态。成长的过程中，我们应该学会为自己的行为负责，与其去买怨别人，不如改变自己。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从中，苍鹭介绍了两件新的事情：人生坐标与心理游戏。人们的观念其实是从幼年就开始形成的，不同的家庭，环境，教育，都会使他们看待事物的视角不同，最终视角的形成也会使人们坚持这种观点与选择，变成自证预言。在四五岁左右，会尝试回答两个问题：‘我是怎么看自己的？我好吗？’，‘我是怎么看别人的？他们好吗？’。 下面的人生坐标图反映了不同的状态。苍鹭举了两个例子：我不好，你好；和我好，你不好。我认为这两种状态反映了蛤蟆和他的父母，一个在不断的打压自己，让自己感到不幸；另一个则在不断的指责对方，让对方愤怒，难堪。&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后一次的谈话中，苍鹭与蛤蟆进行了平等的谈话，反思了前几次面谈。蛤蟆从对苍鹭的依赖变成了对抗依赖，最后变的更加独立。苍鹭也最后提出了一点，在情绪中学习，成长，学会共情，达到最高的境界。
谈话结束后，蛤蟆与朋友们进行了聚会，每个人阐明了自己的计划。虽然要与朋友们告别，但他们在精神上获得了新生，得到了满足，突破了自我。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故事中，唯一令我比较困惑的是为什么蛤蟆在倒数第二次面谈对苍鹭发脾气。他说他受够了苍鹭每次问他的一连串的问题，这使他困惑，迷茫。我可能从未进行过心理咨询，但我实在不能够理解为什么蛤蟆会发脾气。我一直认为心理咨询就是去说出自己的困难，痛苦，然后再反思，思考自己学到了什么，做错了什么，所以我觉得苍鹭做的并没有任何问题。再仔细想想，最后蛤蟆又说了‘你跟我父亲一样’，可能会不会是他把父亲的形象带入进了苍鹭的形象，实现了对父亲反抗，不再受父亲的打压。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看完书后，我觉得我对心理咨询师这个职业更加感兴趣了。我觉得这个职业能够聆听到其他人的故事，并引领他们去更好地认识自我，更够独立反思，学会理解情绪，控制情绪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;部分笔记&#34;&gt;部分笔记：
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不好，你好（极端：自杀
“这代表了一个人的行为态度，这类人认为自己很差劲，别人都比他好。“
游戏名字：我真不幸 容易让人抑郁，感到不幸
Poor Little Old Me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我好，你不好（极端：谋杀
能让玩家感到愤怒，或者至少能让他们对别人评头论足。处于这个心理坐标的人常常会占据权力和权威的制高点，
看上去好像在这个坐标的人总需要攻击或者谴责别人。
Now I’ve got you, son of bitch&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Self Determination Theory</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/self-determination-theory/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/self-determination-theory/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a psychological view, self-determination means the result or process of acting under one’s own choice, ‘particularly to behaviours that improves one’s circumstance’ (APA dictionary of psychology, 2018; Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Self-determination is useful in overcoming fears, giving humans the courage to achieve more, as did Jerry when going through the tunnel (Lessing, 1957), bringing him growth and maturity. For adolescents, or even young children like Jerry, self-determination could help them make vocational decisions, informed choices, and increase independence (Field, Hoffman, Posch 1997). Increased motivation and satisfaction of three fundamental needs also increases self- determination, helping ones to persevere through challenges. Elouise Cobell presents such characteristic when going against the U.S. government, fighting for the rights of the Blackfoot tribe, bringing justice eventually (Janko, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is linked with motivation, which is performed through the fulfilment of three fundamental needs. It is highly valued for the benefit it brings and is becoming increasingly important in our everyday lives. The three fundamental needs, competence, relatedness and autonomy is shown to increase motivation. These are shown to be important since it fosters innovation, engagement, wellbeing and allows us to adapt in the constant change of opportunities. (Souders, 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is a crucial factor in personal growth, as it empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Fulfilling the fundamental needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness fosters motivation, gives rise to self-determination and fosters personal growth. This essay is going to look at self-determination in the aspects of the three fundamental needs and motivation, and its implications in the education context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the self-determination theorem, the concepts of the three fundamental needs should be defined. Autonomy means to have freedom and be in control of one’s own choice, which affirms their inner thoughts (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Being in control of one’s own choices could give out energy, and wholeness, and avoid self-fragmentation, useful in developmental stages (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Relatedness means the need to be connected with others, to feel belonging and responsibility in a group (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Achieving a sense of belonging could be helpful for individuals, gaining support, resources, and attachment (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Competence means how prepared a person is for the task to achieve wanted outcomes (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). According to Deci and Ryan (2010), competence is important because a person willing to learn would be actively seeking knowledge, and open to new cultures and new things, providing them with social interaction or survival, while those with little competence could be ill-prepared for future situations. Each of these needs, positive or negative, are all important to enhance self-determination. Jerry as a character in Lessing’s short story “Through the Tunnel” demonstrates self- determination in going through the tunnel. This is manifested by the three fundamental needs. Jerry experiences a strong desire for social connection which fits the definition of relatedness in the self-determination theory, as evidenced by his isolation from his peers and his yearning to belong to the group of older boys. However, their rejection after he discovers his inability to follow them through the tunnel deepens his sense of isolation. The desire for belonging with the older boys increases fuels his drive and wants to go through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessing highlights Jerry&amp;rsquo;s development of competence through his preparations. He demonstrates initiative by requesting goggles from his mother and practices breath control with such dedication that his nose bleeds. These actions showcase his growing confidence and acquired skills. After gaining the confidence and preparations needed to go through the tunnel, this increases his willingness to do so. Additionally, Jerry exhibits autonomy throughout his endeavor. He makes independent choices, acting without his mother&amp;rsquo;s interference, and ultimately chooses to confront his fear by entering the tunnel on his own volition. This motivates him and moves him towards the act of going through the tunnel. These fundamental factors all enhances motivation, which in turn contributes to his self-determination, giving him the vitality to go through the hole, to continue even if he’s facing obstacles and challenges, and eventually overcome the fear of going through the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory postulates that the satisfaction of the three fundamental needs sustains intrinsic motivation. According to Patall and Cooper ( 2008 ), given the freedom of choice, intrinsic motivation could increase because of the increased willingness to do so. Autonomy fosters intrinsic motivation. This is apparent when students are allowed to participate in activities they find interesting, challenging, or unfamiliar (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Relatedness, gaining support from students, and feeling connected tend to increase motivation (Ryan &amp;amp; Powelston, 1991). Gaining enough satisfaction from peers might foster a sense of belonging, so one might get the sense that doing so again could make them feel the sense of belonging again, making them more determined and increasing their motivation. Although competence beliefs are not shown to be too highly correlated with intrinsic motivation, certain experiences could affect both factors, increasing confidence and interests, and willingness to learn (Spinath &amp;amp; Steinmayr, 2008). As stated by Dysvik and Gagne, one hypothesis was that the needs worked in synergy, and the satisfaction of the two needs, relatedness and autonomy, or autonomy and competence could all enhance intrinsic motivation. Although competence wasn’t a main factor for increasing intrinsic motivation, it acted as an essence for intrinsic motivation (Dysvik &amp;amp; Gagne, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is also reported that autonomous motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, are the bases of self-determination, and promotes self-determination, influencing the well-being and the engagement of individuals (Main, 2023; Deci and Ryan, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with self-determination, autonomous motivation is when a person behaves in a way governed by oneself with internal or integrated motivation. “Intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000), giving oneself more choice and interests in doing something. Integration happens when people adopt a value or regulation by others and believe it, following the rule, believing that it is crucial to their goal or it’s their own choice to do so (Deci, 1994). These two ways of motivation leads individuals to autonomously pursue these values because they are aligned with their personal goals and interests, contributing to autonomous motivation. Elouise Cobell, shows autonomous motivation in standing up for what she believes is right, advocating rights for the Blackfeet tribe (Janko, 2013). The internal sense of justice and control of her rights perhaps fuelled her and motivated her to act. Her connection and belongingness to the tribe could also have been a factor. These intrinsic motivational factors made her continue restlessly for what she did until she passed away. Autonomous motivation has its benefits in other aspects such as gaining psychological wellbeing, continuing a healthy habit, promoting the whole wellbeing of a society (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2012 ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled motivation, on the other hand, is when a person behaves in a way due to external factors or introjection. “Extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome.” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Introjection happens when taking in values from others while not truly internalizing it as one’s own. This could be due to external pressures and could result in feelings such as guilt or anxiety (Deci, 1994). These are shown to lower autonomy, resulting in lowered self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory is applied in multiple aspects such as education, nursing, sports and work. In education, self-determination theory is applied in online learning, teachers and students to research why students are motivated to learn and how to provide a better environment to foster self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multiple researches, the researchers focus on the three basic needs and motivation in education. When the three basic needs of self-determination theory are met, the students are more likely to be engaged in school. Earl reported that students with the highest satisfaction of the three needs experienced the most achievement, engagement and had most positive effects (2019). Autonomous goals and motivation is also an evident factor in education, affecting their behaviours. Guay reports that autonomous motivation results in more positive outcomes, and pursuing autonomous goals could increase motivation, creating a positive cycle for improving education behaviours (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the academic achievements and perseverance of students, programs promoting motivation or fulfilling the three basic needs are encouraged to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting and increasing autonomy is one way. Reeve, develops an experiment where teachers receive training on autonomy support, achieving the answer that the more autonomy given to students by teachers, the more engaged they were (2004). Chiu does something similar with the during the context of online learning, showing that “students feel a stronger sense of autonomy to choose their preferred technologies to learn with, a stronger sense of competence to access online learning, and a stronger sense of relatedness to connect with teachers for communication.”(Chiu, 2021) Chiu’s research also supports the claim that increasing fundamental needs of students could increase their engagement, emphasizing that teachers should fully satisfy the three needs of the students to increase their motivation. Su and Reeve suggest there are a few ways to foster autonomy support such as considering students’ perspectives, avoiding the use of controlling language, encouraging them to solve their problems; giving out instruction manuals, providing knowledge and training to mostly teachers (especially those just beginning their career or not so familiar with fostering self- determination), and a short follow-up after training (2010). Such programs should be encouraged to be implemented because it increases the autonomy of the students, and could be easily done online or offline. Such programs mostly have a positive effect, although the duration is unknown. There are a few limitations in the program, such as the sample size, and it should try to be implemented into more environments, such as home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs focusing on enhancing the needs in different subjects are also experimented. Two programs, the Reading within Family and School program and the CASIS-Écriture training program (cooperation, authentic activities, support for autonomy, involvement, and structure) are used to enhance their reading and writing skills respectively. The first program intervened in school and family environments to encourage reading, to further enhance their curiosity and willingness to read. Through the process, their autonomy and readiness is rising, which leads to the increase of intrinsic motivation. The study showed that intervening highly increased their engagement, having a five-month lasting effect. The second focused on motivation and writing, providing CASIS training courses for teachers. The study showed that trained teachers gave students more autonomous motivation in writing compared with controlled students. Providing extra training in school environments for teachers or giving out a free, supportive environment at home are all useful in promoting motivation, giving rise to self-determination. These subject based researches are useful in increasing motivation for reading and writing, although the CASIS program had a limited increase in children’s autonomous motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;increasing-self-determination&#34;&gt;Increasing self-determination
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deci acknowledges that “providing a rationale, acknowledging feelings, and conveying choice are relevant for promoting internalization” (Deci,1994). From the programs used to implement self-determination, it is inferred that creating an environment where one provides one’s thoughts, gives enough freedom for choice, and acknowledges their feelings values their opinions is crucial. Controlling words should also be minimized. This supports integration and intrinsic motivation, further fuelling self-determination and helping personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only so, but people should also be intent on discovering their basic needs to promote intrinsic motivation. To achieve such needs, allowing oneself the freedom of choice and letting one decide what to do in even the smallest of things, such as what to wear could increase autonomy. Giving oneself a challenge and allowing oneself to learn new skills necessary for the challenge could help increase competence, and creating more connections within the society could increase relatedness, increasing determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academic studies, especially, parents or schools should provide environments that provide little external forces. They should give children more choices, allow children to develop their interests, provide favourable challenges (e.g. speech competitions), and give out positive and constructive feedback. In case there is little intrinsic motivation, parents or schools should also let children understand the values of activities they don’t like, such as providing rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although so, it should be acknowledged that different personalities and cultural beliefs could all shape ones’ behavior, limiting their ability of making decisions (Main, 2023), so implementing the same ways to everyone may not be all effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-determination theory offers a structure for understanding self-determination in personal growth and the roles of the basic needs and motivation. As discussed, self- determination, fueled by autonomous motivation and the fulfillment of core needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their full potential. Using examples from Lessing and Janko, understanding the differences and uses of each motivation, and the connections between these factors, environments that nurture self-determination can be created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Dolly the Sheep to Snuppy the Dog, pet cloning is gaining more attention, and the number of people who are considering using this technique to resurrect their pet is climbing. Since commencing operations in 2015, Viagen, a company specializing in pet cloning, has reported an increase in the number of cloning procedures performed. The company has disclosed completing hundreds of procedures to date (Dimitropoulos, 2022). But is this the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet cloning has its ups and downs. This article evaluates the value it has in a scientific view. To sum it up, the merits of pet cloning are controversial in the scientific community, with the main points of the dispute being the process&amp;rsquo;s efficiency, the long-term health implications for cloned animals, and reprogramming considerations surrounding the SCNT technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inefficient-process&#34;&gt;Inefficient Process
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloning of animals typically utilizes the SCNT (Somatic cell nuclear transfer) technique . The cloning process starts with harvesting the skin cell from the donor animal. The cell is then fused an unfertilized egg removed from the female of the same species with the nucleus (containing DNA) taken away. Fusing the two cells with an electric pulse jump starts cell division, eventually resulting in an embryo. During the early stage, the embryo is impla nted surgically in the surrogate mother. It carries the cloned pregnancies and gives birth to the cloned animal. Though the steps may seem easy, problems occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, cloning has a low success rate. Th e main reason of the l ow success rate could be due to the failure of the development of embryos. In laboratories, only a few cells have developed to become fetuses. After that, “a high rate of fetal, perina tal, and neonatal loss ” is reported (Hare, 2003, p. 271) . Out of the emb ryos implanted into the wombs of 13 sheep, only Dolly survived. (Elsner, 2006) This contributes to the low success rate of cloning, requiring improvements. A low success rate of cloning, supported by Ko’s research, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign ’s College of Veterinary Medicine, claimed that the success rate of cloning dogs is around 20 percent (Brogan, 2018). Although quite high compared with cloning other animals, the success rate still implies that trying to clone 100 dogs could mean failure in the other 80, wasting 80% of the lives of cloned animals. According to Dr. Smith, the reason of low success rat e cou ld be due to the dogs having unique reprodu ctive cycles and involving a considerable number of genes (Brogan, 2018). This requires further research and could be improved until the technology is commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, t he process wastes numerous a nimals, eggs, and embryos. Snuppy, the cloned dog, and his twin came from the three pregnan cies, 1,000 embryos implanted into 123 surrogates. Snuppy and his twin was the outcome of the three pregnancies of more than 1,000 embryos implanted into the 123 sur rogates. Brogan claims, “You need a good number of dogs to do this type of cloning, ” (2018, para. 17) implying that the process is extremely wasteful. Elsner agrees by claiming that with dolly, “the 277 attempts to fuse an adult sheep cell nucleus with an egg, only 27 embryos developed normally for a week.” (2006 , p. 597). This process wastes a tremendous amount of eggs, and embryos, surpassing those in natural reproduction. (Elsner, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;health-and-longevity-p-roblems&#34;&gt;Health and Longevity P roblems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the hardships of turning into a fetus, cloned animals encounter more trouble. Following birth, clon ed offspring might not survive. During the 24h of birth, clones could die due to “ respiratory distress; increased birth weight; or cardiovascular anomalies, some of which have resulted in hypertrophic liver and dilated major blood vessels. ”(Hare, 2003, p.271) The lives of the clone ends abruptly , just after they’re born .Even if they do survive, pets might age faster or have a higher risk of obtain ing diseases. The fact that the c hromosomes taken from th e donor , shorter than normal , might give clones a shorter life span. Donors could have defects in their organs, which co uld pass on to cloned animals. Dolly, for example, died at six, which was half the lifespan of an average sheep. The mice cloned from somatic cells died early , and their lifespan was reported to be shorter than the genotype, presenting the possibility of the such technology’s long -term detrimental effects (Ogonuki, 2002). However, Bu rgstaller ’s (2017) research provides an opposing view. O ther sheep that were cloned with the same cell line as Dolly lived close to their natural lifespan. The maximum lifespan of most animals cloned (such as mice, sheep, cats, and dogs) has been proven to reach their natural lifespans, although the cloned lifespan of oth er species has yet to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim reported that the health Snuppy , the first cloned dog, was monitored throughout its life. Notably, both Snuppy and the dog that provided the genetic mat erial (cell donor) developed cancer at similar ages. Reclones of Snuppy are not expected to age in an accelerated speed nor would the y exhibit a greater tendency of develop ing diseases than naturally bred animals (Kim, 2017). The reason of why Dolly lived shorter while Snuppy didn’t is unanswered. The health and longevity of cloned animals are still uncertain and additional research could be made to refine the answer to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scnt---reprogramming-and-a-dvancements&#34;&gt;SCNT - Reprogramming and A dvancements
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades -old, the SCNT process was widely used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning and has been applied to the cloning of a variety of animals, such as pigs, goats, cats, and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the success rate is very low, 3.4% -13% for each embryo transferre d, and even lower, 0.3% -1.7% for a reconstructed oocyte (Burgstaller, 2017). The efficiency varies bet ween 0.1% - 16% (Srirattana, 2022), though recent technology is said to have improved the efficiency, and further refinements would be made to SCNT to make better use of it (Matoba, 2018). Numerous approaches to increase efficiency have been utilized in oocytes, cloned embryos, and cell d onors (Srirattana , 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still barriers to the reprogramming of genes, such as genome instability and incomplete reprogramming , with the latter causing problems abnormalities such as large birth weight, unusual organ size, respiratory problems, and weakened immune systems (Gouveia, 2020). It should be noted though, that different species could exhibit different problems. Bovine clones could become obese, while pig clones would be concerned with underweight and underdeveloped placenta problems, an d murine clones would be i nvolved with abnormal placentas (Gouveia, 2020) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somatic cell nuclear transfer has potential, but there are still problems to overcome such as low efficiency, and reprogramming difficulties leading to abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though numerous people are willing to resurrect their pets using cloning, there could be potential drawbacks. The efficiency and the health of the clones are still debatable, which would vary depending on different species, different donors, and different techniques used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Somatic Cell Nuclear T ransfer technology is still developing, and is beneficial in ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as cloning animals to keep their highly valued traits, increasing numbers of endangered species, or creating transgenic animals for medical u se (Sumer, 2009), it is questionable whether pet cloning is worth it. Dr. Robert Klitzman (2018) , Columbia University ’s academic director of the master of sci ence in bioethics program speaks out his concerns that the use of pet cloning isn’t beneficial to the health of people or pets, and claims that such operations should only be implemented if it increases the advancement of medical and scientific research. While some people see pet cloning as a way to cope with the loss of a beloved pet, it should raise concerns about its little scientific value, ethical implications and accessibility only to those with significant financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;摘要&#34;&gt;摘要
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;自古至今，屋顶在人们的生活中不可缺，它不仅起到遮风、挡雨、防晒、保温、隔热的作用，同时还代表着家庭和睦、民生安全，更在历史中象征着权力地位。屋顶所处地区的气候特征影响屋顶屋顶结构，人们的品味、历史的进程，也在潜移默化地作用于屋顶结构样式的演进。不同地区的屋顶样式、曲度、坡度各不相同，每一种屋顶都有其独特的优势，亦存在缺陷。长久以来人们试图找到最适合某一地区的最优屋顶配置，但由于环境、经济、人文的多种因素，此问题很难完美解答。因此，本文根据题目中的三个问题，试图找到不同地区屋顶的最佳配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;针对问题一，本文根据雨水从屋檐抛出的最远距离和落雨量的密集区域判断屋顶抵挡暴雨的能力。本文首先列举了典型的 7 种不同类型的屋顶——悬山顶、硬山顶、
庑殿顶等，然后使用catcher pro等软件模拟了其中 4 种屋顶在暴雨来临时的水流抛出落点，最后结合上述流体模型找出最佳的屋顶配置。在此问题中，本建模小组将屋顶形状抽象为其屋檐对应的曲线方程，并根据此方程使用catcher pro和fluent进行数据模拟，得出暴雨水流落点的相关数据。随后利用权重分析的方法得出了能够最好的将雨水‘抛出’的屋顶——坡屋顶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;针对问题二，本文先确定了要研究的屋顶表征——曲度和倾斜角度，随之又找出了影响表征的因素，包括环境、经济、人文三方面。为了找出具体、准确的数值，本文在数学模型中暂时排除了人文因素，主要关注于环境和经济因素。为了找出普遍优点，本建模小组先找出了五个分布在不同地区的省份的特色房屋建筑，测量出了具体数值并且使用PCA分析法找到了主要的影响因素，比较了该因素与屋顶的相关性。随后，为解决“找到不同地区的最佳屋顶配置”的问题，我们使用了商权法-TOPSIS最
短路径分析法客观地确定评分，再将屋顶坡度以及曲率和纬度的关系式一一带入，找出适用于不同地区的屋顶最优配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本文的创新之处在于第一问的仿真模拟模型和第二问的解题方法。第一问使用了catch up的3D建模并用fluent真实的模拟出了暴雨的具体发生情况，随机出雨滴大小与雨滴分布位置。同时屋顶的建模也还原了最真的的样貌，可以最真实的观察出暴雨时滴落雨滴的抛出距离。第二问中，本建模小组将所有指标与纬度建立了联系，确定了函数关系，使用PCA找到了主要响因素，再将此带入到TOPSIS模型中去客观的确定评分，找出最优配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;关键词：&lt;/strong&gt; 屋顶；屋顶坡度；传统屋檐； &lt;em&gt;PCA&lt;/em&gt; ；熵权法； &lt;em&gt;Topsis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-问题重述与分析&#34;&gt;1. 问题重述与分析
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-问题背景&#34;&gt;1.1 问题背景
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;宋代的陆游曾在《暴雨》中写过：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;风怒欲掀屋，雨来如决堤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;孤灯映窗灭，羁鸟就檐栖。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;屋顶在众人的生活中起到了重要的角色，它不仅能够抵御自然外界的不利因素，给我们提供庇护，还能够体现出美学价值。在亚洲传统屋顶，尤其是中国屋顶中，屋顶的重要组成部分就是飞檐。飞檐扩大了采光面，还能够将雨水抛出，远离建筑物，利于排水。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;历史中随着朝代的更迭，地域的变迁，飞檐的形式也越来越多，翘起的角度，长度也不同。于是该如何从不同类型的飞檐找出排水功能最好的引起了人们的注意，更是引发出了人们对翘角屋的重要程度以及适合的不同地域的屋顶配置的好奇心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是，由于评选指标各异，人们观点不一致，无法确定出最好的屋檐。因此，选取合适指标并建立科学的数学建模去找出最好的以及合适屋檐变得必要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-问题重述&#34;&gt;1.2 问题重述
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;问题一要求建模团队参考中国传统屋顶在没有凹陷点，特殊排水系统，并基于实际情况下用雨水从屋檐‘被甩出’的距离来衡量哪种屋顶形状在暴雨中最好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;问题二要求建模团队找到历史中其他地区不用翘角屋顶而用简单的屋顶的影响指标，并建立评判特定气候下对应该气候的特定屋顶的优势的模型，再找到不同地区的最佳屋顶配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;13-问题分析&#34;&gt;1.3 问题分析
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;对于问题一，本文首先辨别了图片中的屋顶类型，并找到典例屋顶建立曲线方程，用此建立模型。再明确暴雨定义及暴雨量后，开始模拟暴雨情况下该屋檐对雨水抛出的远近程度，通过模拟结果的评比找出最佳屋檐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于问题二，对于第二题的三个小问题，本文现先考虑到了环境，人文，经济指标，根据文献以及讨论选取指标，在逐步将问题拆为三部分，影响屋顶的形状的的因素，找到特定气候下该地区的屋顶的优点，确定每个地区的合适屋顶配置，逐个进行分析。首先对第一小问，本文先确立了影响屋顶建筑样貌结构的指标，并找出量化结果，随后找出气候指标与屋檐的表征的函数关系，第二问本文使用了TOPSIS法建立模型，将第一问的数据及指标带入找出各个屋顶的优势。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流程如图 1 所示&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-模型全局假设&#34;&gt;2. 模型全局假设
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;假设题一中测量的四角攒尖的屋顶的曲面相同&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;忽略计算屋檐上装饰品（定义为与屋檐为一体）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;假设无自然灾害影响房屋&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;第二题中，本建模小组全面的进行了综合，跨领域的思考。本文从经济，环境方面两个一级指标向下细化出二级，三级分级指标并针对各项指标进行细化，量化，如下表显示。各指标在数据类型上可分为数值型（通过查阅资料得出）以及布尔值（判断有无，有为 1 ，无为 0 ）来判定房顶的优良性和合适性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;变量在下表中列出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下面我们将解释各项指标的选取因素：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过文献及资料搜索，本建模小组发现中国古建筑的特征体现了当地的地域特征和风俗文化。中国古建筑是人类和外部环境决定下而生成的产物，在各个地域都表现出了不同的特点。尤其是屋顶，其结构以及装饰都体现出了当地习俗及地域性特征。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;311-环境&#34;&gt;3.1.1 环境
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;通过资料搜索，中国古建筑及民居体现出了当地的地域环境，坡顶的倾斜程度，翘角的有无，都与它处在的地理位置，环境息息相关。环境可以通过气候和地理位置体现，影响到不同地区的建筑形式，本文将此作为二级指标。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;气候：及天气现象对房顶的影响，影响气候的基本因素为降水和温度，可以将降水降雪温度的多少以及变化量根据月平均温度，月平均降水降雨量进行量化；同时气候也包括风力，风速，太阳光照角度，辐射强度，日照时长的对天气影响，可以通过每月正午太阳高度角，紫外线指数，太阳日照时数进行量化，为三级指标。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生态资源：可以从可利用地以及是否有对应屋顶的材料进行判定。历史上，是否有相对应的材料直接决定了当地是否有能力建造出相应形状的屋顶，同时可利用地的占比也决定了房型的大小，从而导致了屋顶的坡度不同，改变了屋顶占有的空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;312-经济&#34;&gt;3.1.2 经济
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;建造房屋以及屋顶时，人们还应该考虑到经济因素是否能够支持该建筑的搭建以及保持。根据经济可以分为建造成本以及维护成本两个二级指标。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;建造成本：在考虑建造房屋房顶时，应该考虑它的用材，及地区经济能力，和搭建它所需要的劳动力两个三级指标，可以通过城市年度GDP以及中国人口密度分布反映出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;维护成本：搭建完后，它的成本还需要考虑维护房屋的定期维修时间，单次维修费用等。通过是否为土石，钢筋建造或是否为木材竹子建造可以判断出房顶的耐用程度和坚固程度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;313-人文&#34;&gt;3.1.3 人文
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;建筑常常受到当地的文化习俗，历史传统，美学价值观的影响。不仅仅是国内，国外的历史建筑屋顶也因受到文化，不同时期的影响而构造结构不同。此因素十分重要，但因为难以测量数据，不会在模型中详细且具体体现出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-模型优劣分析&#34;&gt;3.2 模型优劣分析
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCA主成分分析法可以帮助本研究找到对屋顶形状影响较大的因素（如：气温、降水等等）。PCA可以实现数据降维的作用，同时保留大部分数据特征，有利于简化本研究。在得出对屋顶设计影响最大的因素后，本研究可以推出屋顶的优点。例如：如果降水量是影响较大的因素，且南方的屋顶由于降水量较大而设计的坡度较陡，则这种表征就可以被看作这个屋顶的优势，有效回答题目问题。但是，PCA模型也有必然缺陷。虽然PCA在算法中保留了大部分数据特征，但是在数据降维的过程中会丢失信息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本研究还结合了熵权法和TOPSIS分析法进行研究。为了避免人为赋值权重所带有的不严谨性，熵权法可以在数据中计算出每一个影响因素的权重，体现出本研究的严谨性。同时，我们使用TOPSIS对屋顶方案进行打分，结合熵权法所赋予的权重，得出每一个屋顶的评分。这样，本研究就得出不同地区的最佳屋顶配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-问题一求解&#34;&gt;4 问题一求解
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-屋面方程的建立&#34;&gt;4.1 屋面方程的建立.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;在本问题中，根据文献搜索并与图中的屋顶的比较，本建模小组将图片中的屋顶类型分为卷棚类屋顶，破山顶，悬山顶，硬山顶，四角攒尖和庑殿顶。在寻找屋顶曲面方程时，为找出各屋顶的方程结构判断了屋顶是否是中心对称，轴对称或不规则的图形。从侧面测量，本建模小组确定了悬山顶，硬山顶等屋顶的屋顶曲线方程能够用轴对称分析；从俯视看，本建模小组确定了四角攒尖为中心对称，再从侧面角度计算出了屋顶的曲线方程。对于庑殿顶，由于为不规则图形，需要将图形切割分析出屋顶的曲面方程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;411-轴对称&#34;&gt;4.1.1 轴对称.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;轴对称屋面的典例：（卷棚式）悬山顶，（尖山式）硬山顶，坡屋顶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从正面看，悬山顶和硬山顶的样式为矩形，从侧面切开后函数图像都是一样的，不会变化，可以直接从横切面转化出屋檐斜面的函数。本建模小组用了根据屋檐的函数图像在Logger pro上进行线性拟合。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;412-中心对称&#34;&gt;4.1.2 中心对称
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;中心对成屋面的典例：四角攒尖顶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为中心对称不能完全确定出房顶的曲面方程，故需要先证明四角攒尖房顶的中心对称可以转换为轴对称，下面证明中心对称与轴对称屋面的方程拓扑同型：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如图所示，作俯视图（以俯视正方形中心对称屋面为例）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于四角攒尖顶，先俯视看图。建立坐标系，将顶点设为O，再用Z轴沿OD切一个面，使D点与ξ 1 轴相交；再用Z轴沿OC切一个面，使C点与ξ 2 轴相交。两个切面上曲线如图所示，下面证明两个曲线同型：做PQ与CE平行，得出△OPQ&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与△OEC相似，得出OP/OQ=OE/OC。
这表明两曲线只发生了自变量的伸缩变换，即&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$
y = f(\xi) \rightarrow y = f(k\xi), \quad \text{where } k \in (0, 1]
$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由此可知，中心对称的切线的函数类型没有变，可以从拓扑结构角度转化为轴对称函数型屋面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;413-不规则图形&#34;&gt;4.1.3 不规则图形
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;不对称型屋面的典例：庑殿顶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于庑殿顶，可以先从正面看，将此分为左边，中间，右边三个部分。因为中间为矩形，可以得知它中心对称，在侧面进行拟合。可以将左右两边看为中心对称，再次通过中心对称的方法进行拟合。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-拟合与仿真模拟&#34;&gt;4.2 拟合与仿真模拟.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;通过搜索资料，本建模小组先确定了暴雨的定义。在 24 小时中降水量为 50 毫米或以上被称为‘暴雨’。本建模小组先用catchup对屋顶方程式进行了3D建模，再在Fluent软件中模拟了100mm/d的降水量，用此方法测量出了雨水抛出的距离。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拟合结果如图所示。通过图像可得知（尖山）硬山顶的曲线方程为五次函数，而四角攒尖的屋顶因为中心对称，拟合后的次数为五次，故归并到（尖山）硬山顶的五次函数中，结果如图所示。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;破山顶拟合后的函数为一次函数，对于（卷棚）悬山顶，拟合后得出的函数图像为二次函数；而（卷棚）硬山顶拟合后得出的函数图像为余弦函数，同时也测得（尖山）悬山顶为高斯函数。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据表格给出的数据，本建模小组考虑到了影响水从屋檐抛出的距离决定出最好屋檐的因素，及雨水抛到最远的距离和降雨量最多的距离。本建模小组决定根据客观事实分析出权重并找出最佳屋顶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基于常识，还有部分文献的参考，本建模小组认为降雨量最多的点占的权重要比抛出最远距离明显重要，因为大部分降雨抛出的距离反映出了屋檐抛出雨水的基本规律，于是将降水量最多的点赋上了0.7的权重，将抛出最远距离赋上了0.3的权重。表格反映了流体运动的模拟，X轴表示了屋面，Y轴表示了平移方向，Z轴表示了落雨量。当雨向下落时，靠近屋檐的一部分会垂直下落，落雨量较少，随着距离远后，不仅会有垂直下落的雨，还会有从屋顶上下滑，抛出的雨点。距离变得更远后，落雨和抛出的水滴逐渐减小。程序见附录5.3，结果如表 2 所示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;将X轴上的各个与权重相乘再相加，得出最后数据分别为-9.689,-10.356 ,-9.889和-9.701。将各个数据乘以他们的倒数，根据比较，得出-9.689的值最大，评分最高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;421-结论&#34;&gt;4.2.1 结论
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;故根据评分可以得出一次函数的方程，也就是坡山顶，在暴雨中形状最好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-确定影响因素&#34;&gt;5.1 确定影响因素
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;通过观察，不同纬度，地区的不同气候会导致屋檐表征不同。对于屋檐表征和形状，可以分成屋顶的陡峭程度（倾斜角度）以及屋顶的弯曲程度（弧度）。我国疆土辽阔，为区分我国的地区差异，温度带就被分为了寒温带，中温带，暖温带，亚热带，热带；还将我国的降水线分为了400mm,800mm,1600mm，可见我国气候的广泛，丰富程度。太阳光的照射角度和不同地区接收到的光照强度，风力风速也都体现出来各个地区之间的差异。为了庇护，遮风挡雨，适应环境，建筑的风格，屋顶表征就大有差异。不同地区不同的经济水平，文化风俗也连同环境差异或多或少的影响到了房屋建筑的屋顶的样貌表征。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-建立特定气候下屋顶的优点的模型&#34;&gt;5.2 建立特定气候下屋顶的优点的模型
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;本题中，本建模小组着了五个差异较大的地区进行模拟比较，于是找到了不同地区，不同纬度的五个省份，北京，新疆，云南，江苏和黑龙江，并参考了该地区的气候和带有特色的居民建筑，寻找气候与屋顶类型的相关性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本建模小组根据各个地区的特色建筑进行拟合，算出屋面的的曲率以及坡度（通过平均最大值以及最小值）（得出的数据都取了绝对值）。北京的特色建筑，四合院的悬山顶的屋面曲率为0.0015463，坡度为0.64428。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新疆的特色建筑，阿以旺，根据文献资料所得屋顶为平顶，故该屋面的曲率以及坡度都为零。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;云南的特色建筑，竹楼，屋面曲率为0.00068666，坡度为1.3276。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;黑龙江的特色建筑屋顶为硬山顶，屋面曲率为0.0017969，坡度为0.58316。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;江苏的特色民居建筑的坡度为0.54498，屋面曲率为0.00070431。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;屋面坡度、曲率随纬度变化如下图所示&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随后，本建模小组又根据指标和所搜寻数据并且使用Excel算出了不同地区三年平均气温，降水等给类气候指标，使数据更加简便，更加方便使用PCA找出影响
最大因素，数据表格见下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;使用PCA后找到了影响屋顶表征的主要因素，图确定了影响屋顶的主要因素，该因素长度越大，贡献占比越大；同时也计算出各个因素与屋顶坡度的关联性，体现了五个地区不同纬度上不同因素对该地区的贡献值，当贡献率为负的时候，该因素与该地区呈现负相关，贡献率为正的时候，该因素呈正相关。系数热度图和射线分析图如下图所示&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;通过分析，本建模小组得出结论：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于云南，因为降雨的贡献率为正，它与坡度呈正相关。云南降水大，所以屋顶坡度大，屋顶这样的建设有利于排水；对于江苏，人口密度较大，与屋顶表征呈负相关，当人口密度变大后，为了节省用地并提供足够的房屋，屋面坡度较小；对于北京，因为GDP的贡献率是正相关，当地人的经济能力较强，可能对于屋顶的外貌较为注重，所以当地人们更喜欢坡度较大的房屋，因为更加的美观；或比如对于新疆，太阳辐射量又与屋顶坡度呈负相关，所以当地的屋顶坡度十分小，曲面率也较小，这是因&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;为当地太阳辐射大；对于黑龙江，风速大，风速成正相关，当风速较大时，屋顶斜率，曲面程度也就较大，能够抵御强风，降雪多，降雪呈负相关，所以屋面较平，这样更方便承载雪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;53-找出不同地区的最佳配置&#34;&gt;5.3 找出不同地区的最佳配置
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;本建模小组在不同纬度找出了不同的气候，使用MatLab和熵权法客观地确定了权重（各个气候指标与纬度的关联程度）。随后，使用MatLad和TOPSIS进行评分，使用确定的权重，数据，根据TOPSIS客观地确定了分数等级。因为有五个地区，所以分出了五个等级，对应纬度大小（五为最小，一为最大）。然后通过观察法确定了屋顶坡度，屋顶弧度与纬度的函数，之后将函数分为五个段，每一段函数都对应了不同的屋顶类型，以 5 度为间隔，在二十五度到 45 度区间之内，将五个等级和五段函数一一对应，确定了结论如下图。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;图中：A对应的城市为昆明，B为南京，C为北京，D为乌鲁木齐，E为哈尔滨，但运行出来的结果为 45321 。MatLab得出的结果与ABCDE对应的前两个城市相反。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;结论：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;悬山顶为北京的最佳配置，四角攒尖为昆明的最佳配置，坡屋顶为南京的最佳配置，平顶为乌鲁木齐的最佳配置，硬山顶为哈尔滨的最佳配置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;分析：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有关南京与昆明的民居情况不符合现实的原因，本组将其归因为二者在人文因素上的差异，尤其是在历史因素方面。&lt;/p&gt;
