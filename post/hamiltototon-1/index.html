<p>Time:</p>
<h3 id="scene-1">Scene 1</h3>
<p><em>Introduction, several people recite:</em></p>
<p>PREVIOUS ANCESTOR: (standing in the middle of the stage)
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman,
dropped in the middle of a forgotten Spot in the Caribbean
by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar? (rise arms, move to the right)</p>
<p>PREVIOUS ANGELICA:
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter (move to the left)</p>
<p>PREVIOUS MADISON:
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter (stay in the middle)</p>
<p>PREVIOUS MADISON:
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain</p>
<p>PREVIOUS ANCESTOR:
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don&rsquo;t forget from whence you came, and
The world&rsquo;s gonna know your name. What&rsquo;s your name, man?”</p>
<p>ALL: Alexander Hamilton!</p>
<p><em>Background music Alexander Hamilton</em></p>
<h3 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h3>
<p><em>Hamilton (present) is on the cruise, reminiscing about his conversation with his mother. He stands on the deck, but his mind is pulled towards the conversation with his mother. Mother steps into the light.</em></p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(gentle)</em> In the candlelit shadows of my youth,
Mother’s words, a gentle breeze, whispered in my ear,
<em>(here mother appears)</em> &ldquo;Son, hold fast to your dreams, let no doubt interfere.&rdquo;
<em>(breath)</em>, in New York, I can be a new man…</p>
<p>MOTHER: <em>(echo like, tenderly)</em> Alexander, let your spirit soar,
With resolve and courage, open every door.&quot;</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(determined)</em> And so I vowed, beneath the flickering flame,
To ingrain my name upon the walls of fame,
With every word I wrote, page I turned,
I knew my journey&rsquo;s path, I would fiercely defend.</p>
<p>MOTHER: <em>(gentle but firm)</em> &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; <em>(whispered)</em> &ldquo;never yield,
In the face of adversity, let your spirit wield,
For greatness lies not in fortune&rsquo;s hand,
But in the heart of one who dares to stand.&rdquo;
I see your dreams, divine,
Which shall lead you to the stars that shine,
With every step, with every breath you take,
Let your spirit soar, let your dreams awake.&quot;</p>
<p>HAMILTON: My mother&rsquo;s words, a beacon in the night,
Guided me through darkness, towards the light.
With every heartbeat, every sigh,
I vowed to reach for the endless sky,
For in the echoes of my mother&rsquo;s voice,
I found the strength to make my choice.</p>
<p><em>(Alexander then stares straight ahead, his mother steps back, watching his figure tearfully)</em>
MOTHER: &ldquo;Alexander,&rdquo; <em>(whispered)</em>, &ldquo;you are my pride,
In your heart, let courage and honor abide,
For though the road may be long and steep,
Your dreams, my son, are yours to keep.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="scene-3">Scene 3</h3>
<p>Burr:
In early days of America, at King&rsquo;s College&rsquo;s gate,
Alexander Hamilton embarked on a fate.
His words like swords, sharp and clear,
Inspiring patriots, instilling fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up!&rdquo; he cried, “No monarchy&rsquo;s might!”
Kindling revolution&rsquo;s fervent light.
His path was not of words alone,
In battles fierce, his courage shown.</p>
<p>Through war&rsquo;s dark haze, his talent soared,
Winning battles, earning accord.
Washington&rsquo;s eye, keen and bright,
Saw in Hamilton a guiding light.</p>
<p>As war’s end brought a nation&rsquo;s dawn,
Washington, president, honor drawn.
A new chapter, history&rsquo;s page,
Hamilton steps onto a larger stage.</p>
<p><em>Hamilton steps into Washington’s office, filled with books. Washington stands behind the table/ sits in the chair while Hamilton shows him his passions and dreams. Washington admires his ambition and thoughts, asking him if he’d like to be his secretary. During this talk, they are like mentor and student.</em></p>
<p>HAMILTON: Sir, you asked to see me?</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Yes. Hamilton, how come you won’t settle down?</p>
<p>HAMILTON: Sir?</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: <em>(enthusiastically)</em> Don’t get me wrong, Hamilton. I admire your ambition, and I see your desire for state matters. You’re so full of energy, you never seem to stop fighting for what you want.</p>
<p><em>Hamilton smiles sheepishly at his compliment.</em></p>
<p>As we stand here amidst the aftermath of war, I am filled with both hope and concern for our young nation. What do you envision for America&rsquo;s future? What thoughts do you hold?</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(young and passionate)</em> General, I believe America has the potential to become the beacon of liberty and prosperity for all. But to achieve this, we must prioritize economic development and international trade. We need to establish strong financial institutions and promote industrial growth to secure our place on the world stage.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: <em>(encouragingly)</em> Your ambition for America&rsquo;s economic growth is admirable, Hamilton. But let us not forget the importance of unity and diplomacy in our endeavors. We must seek to mend the wounds of war and foster alliances with other nations to ensure our security and prosperity.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: Indeed, sir. I recognize the importance of diplomacy and cooperation in securing our nation&rsquo;s future. I am committed to working tirelessly to strengthen our international relations and promote peace and stability.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON:  Your dedication to our nation&rsquo;s welfare is unquestionable, Hamilton. I have every confidence that you will continue to serve America with honor and distinction.</p>
<p>HAMILTON:  Thank you, General. It is an honor to serve alongside you in the service of our beloved country.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: And speaking of service <em>(smiles cheekily)</em>, perhaps it&rsquo;s time you consider settling down and starting a family. Have you given any thought to finding a suitable partner?</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(laughs)</em> Well, sir, I must confess I have not had much time for such matters. But if you have someone in mind, I am all ears.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Have you heard about the Schuyler family?</p>
<p>HAMILTON: Schuyler? Of course. Everyone in New York knows about them.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: <em>(laughs)</em> I&rsquo;ve heard that Philip Schuyler is looking for a suitable man for his daughters. Perhaps Eliza Schuyler? I think she’ll be at the banquet. Don’t throw away your shot. <em>(winks)</em>
<em>(Music appears- The Schuyler sisters, shouting Eliza) Eliza steps on stage and smiles as Hamilton. Music keeps on playing, but at a lower volume.</em></p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fine young woman, and I believe she would make an excellent match for you.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: Thank you for the suggestion, sir. I will certainly keep it in mind.</p>
<h2 id="act-two-dedication">ACT TWO: DEDICATION</h2>
<p>BURR：</p>
<p>After the ball,
Their feelings known by all,
Eliza and Alexander began to write.</p>
<p>Ink-stain fingers, hearts aflame,
Across the miles, they wrote their names.
Hamilton’s quill, a graceful sweep,
His love for her, greater than an endless sea.
Through distance and time,
Love was hidden in each line.</p>
<p>Vows made, lives intertwined,
Newlywed couples started to dream.<br>
Yet duty called, the nation’s need,
Hamilton answered with fervent speed.</p>
<p>From war to peace, from sword to quill,
He crafted plans with iron will.
The economy’s fate now in his hands,
A visionary’s dream for prosperous lands.</p>
<p>With love and strength, Eliza stood by his side,
Through every storm, through every tide.</p>
<p>Hamilton set forth, with unwavering will.
Although arduous, he spoke his mind
but attracted a rival, one of a kind.</p>
<h3 id="scene-1-1">Scene 1</h3>
<p><em>In their house, right beside the office table, Hamilton is furiously scribbling his thoughts on the paper while his wife is persuading him to take a rest. Hamilton hasn’t slept for a day, making Eliza worried. Eliza tries to give him a break.</em></p>
<p><em>(Hamilton sits at the desk, pen and paper up, writing something)</em></p>
<p><em>(Eliza walks into the office)</em></p>
<p>ELIZA: <em>(Walking beside him and grabbing his attention)</em>
Alexander, you&rsquo;ve been in here for hours. What troubles you so deeply?  Normally, you—</p>
<p>HAMILTON：<em>(turns to look at Eliza)</em>
It&rsquo;s Jefferson. He opposes every move I make, every plan I propose. His resistance is relentless.</p>
<p>He’s just an obstacle on the nation’s road towards glory, I can’t even stand him! We are all valued by Washington, but I don’t get how Jefferson could come up to a position as my equal. My beliefs are better but they all can’t just see that!</p>
<p>ELIZA: <em>(gently)</em> You&rsquo;ve always known there would be opposition. But Washington chose you for a reason. He saw your brilliance, your vision for this nation. Let’s see, when were you nominated as Secretary of the United States Treasury? JUST after the war has gone, right?</p>
<p>HAMILTON：<em>(frustrated)</em> But what if I&rsquo;m not the man he believes I am? What if I&rsquo;m failing him, failing everyone? I, I just…</p>
<p>ELIZA: <em>(firmly)</em> You are not failing. You&rsquo;ve accomplished so much already. Washington trusts you because he knows your capabilities. And I trust you because I see your dedication and your heart.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(softening)</em> It&rsquo;s just&hellip; every step forward feels like ten steps back. I&rsquo;m exhausted, Eliza.</p>
<p>ELIZA: <em>(concerned)</em> I see the strain it&rsquo;s taking on you. Your will is appreciable, but you mustn&rsquo;t forget to take care of yourself. Success is meaningless if it costs you your health.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(looking down)</em> It&rsquo;s hard not to feel overwhelmed. Jefferson&rsquo;s opposition feels like a personal attack intensely sometimes.</p>
<p>ELIZA: Then take a break, Alexander. Clear your mind, regain your strength. Remember, Washington chose you for a reason. And I believe in you, always.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: <em>(nodding slowly)</em> Maybe you&rsquo;re right. Maybe I do need to step back, just for a moment. Then, I’ll be reenergized, back to fight for my country. But before this, just let me scribble a few more words.</p>
<p>ELIZA: <em>(smiling)</em> We&rsquo;ll get through this together. You don&rsquo;t have to carry the burden alone. Take a break!</p>
<p>HAMILTON: Eliza, your support means everything to me.</p>
<p>ELIZA:  Always, my love. Always.</p>
<h3 id="scene-2-1">Scene 2</h3>
<p>BURR:
In the height of a nation, where destinies align,
Two visions clash in the late afternoon shine.
Hamilton and Jefferson, with minds refined,
Prepare to debate, their futures intertwined.</p>
<p>Hamilton commands the Treasury’s might,
A strong central force guiding the night.
Banks and commerce as the nation’s core,
In his detailed plans, prosperity soars.</p>
<p>Jefferson hears the land’s gentle plea,
A republic of farmers, where men are free.
He champions states with a vigilant cry,
For liberty in simplicity, he’ll never deny.</p>
<p>The battle begins, the nation holds its breath,
Two titans prepare, in the face of the test.
Their words will resonate, the future at stake,
As they steer the course America will take.</p>
<p><em>Hamilton and Jefferson are at the round table, and they form a semi circle, Hamilton and Jefferson on opposing sides. They are debating. Other council members sitting beside them, listening to them debate. Burr is the narrator, he stands alone, apart from the scene.</em></p>
<p><em>Two men stand facing each other, voices raised in passionate debate.</em></p>
<p>Jefferson:<em>（拍桌而起）</em>
This is an outrage, Hamilton! We fought a revolution to throw off the shackles of a distant king, and now you want to burden our citizens with the debts of failed states?</p>
<p>Hamilton:<em>（intense and energetic)</em>
Mr. Jefferson, with all due respect, we are not a collection of &ldquo;failed states,&rdquo; but a united nation! These debts were incurred to secure our collective liberty!</p>
<p>Jefferson:
At what cost, Hamilton? By saddling future generations with the financial burdens of the past, we create a new kind of tyranny - one of debt! Where’s the“Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”we claim to chase?</p>
<p>Hamilton:
A temporary burden, sir, to secure a prosperous future! A strong national credit will inspire investment and trade, the lifeblood of any economy!</p>
<p>JEFFERSON: And who benefits from this strong credit, Hamilton? This plan favors the rich at the expense of the common man, the very people who bled for our independence!</p>
<p>HAMILTON：There’s no need for the reason, a wise central place of a country IS TO MAKE THE U.S. better. Even if it means sacrificing our citizens for the government for just a short notice. And uh- you didn’t even fight in the war; why you get a say in this?</p>
<p>JEFFERSON：Strong nation or bloated government? You advocate for a powerful central authority that would crush the very spirit of liberty we fought for! Who knows how long this oppression with last?</p>
<p>HAMILTON: A mighty order is necessary, Mr. Jefferson! Without a central government to manage our finances and foster trade, we risk becoming nothing more than squabbling colonies once again!</p>
<p>JEFFERSON：This is RIDICULOUS. Look at your fake face, calling out for liberty but unable to achieve such in the end. I’ll do what citizens want, BY MYSELF.</p>
<p>HAMILTON: You’re stupid believes are useless, sitting there with Maddison as two shits! You claim to the patriotic but you’re not. Turn around, bend over, I show you where my shoe fits-
<em>(Washington pulls the two brawling people aside. The three leaves)</em></p>
<h2 id="ending">ENDING</h2>
<p><em>Burr and Hamilton闪亮登场 开始决斗 俩人拿把模型枪</em></p>
<p><em>Hamilton 举枪沉默，放一张PPT，黑底白字，那句“我已经虔诚地忏悔，并愿意与所有的人和解，包括伯尔。”“I have repented devoutly and am willing to reconcile with all, including Burr.”</em></p>
<p><em>然后放下枪</em></p>
<p><em>反观BURR 直接一枪击毙&quot;Your deeds will be remembered for generations to come.&quot;</em></p>
<p>*(Hamilton is swarmed with people, and the actors now usher him off stage. Burr stands aside, startled and confused.) *</p>
