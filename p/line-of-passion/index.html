    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Today I‚Äôm going to start with something common in our lives‚Äîbooks. I don‚Äôt know if you could remember properly the first time when you started reading a book. I couldn‚Äôt. But that feeling was something I‚Äôd always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. I don‚Äôt understand passion or love that clearly, but books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.</p>
<p>My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Reading the books, I‚Äôve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings.</p>
<p>But books are more than just exciting escapes. They&rsquo;re also gateways to knowledge. Although I‚Äôm not a big fan of scientific non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. Books on self-control and self-determination has helped me better acknowledge the ways of improving my time management and organization ability. Books on animals and humans taught me more about the development and history, allowing me to acquire more knowledge.</p>
<p>Reading is also a way of communicating thoughts. Reading different books can give us insight to different opinions and thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or just novels can all give readers an inside peek of the authors‚Äô brain, understanding the wisdom of humans. The books I read by Tara Westover and Hermann Hesse were imprinted into my brains. In Educated, I read about the problems and obstacles Westover encountered, I understood her thoughts. I saw her actions when facing violence, facing estrangement and unacceptance; I learned her thoughts when finding out being accepted into colleges, when she finally learned to deal with her family problems. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse. I saw his character, his philosophical theories, and he had an immediate attraction on me. Through him, I started reading and trying more books he wrote, and loved his philosophical and inspiring expressions. The process of reading each book can not only show me the writing styles of authors for me to learn, but it can also reflect their own thoughts that are inspiring to me.
Reading helps. Maybe you‚Äôre anxious, maybe you‚Äôre unsure of what to do, maybe you feel overwhelmed, or maybe you‚Äôre just bored. If so, why not take a chance at reading a book? It can be a great way to relax, filling your mind with wonder and exciting information. Sometimes, diving into a good story can take our minds off our daily troubles and transport us to a different place. Reading might seem not so effective when just starting, but after doing so a long time and looking back, I find it effective in improving my English skills. Nor would it seem fun, but I find enjoyment through the pleasures of reading novels and coming to understand and communicate the symbols and the author‚Äôs true purpose with others.</p>
<p>According to Herman Hesse, ‚Äúthe more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness ‚Äî at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.‚Äù Flipping through the pages and just skimming briefly the content can take you into a new world filled with thoughts of the author, so why not grab a book beside you and give it a try?</p>
