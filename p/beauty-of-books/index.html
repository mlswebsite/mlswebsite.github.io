    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>I‚Äôve heard a lot of unique topics, so I‚Äôm going to start with something common &ndash; books. No matter text books we use for class, books we read outside of school for research, novels for relaxing‚Ä¶ Books are woven into our lives.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time you read a book? I couldn‚Äôt. But that feeling was something I‚Äôd always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. Books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.</p>
<p>My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Just like what Emily Dickinson said, ‚ÄúThere is no Frigate like a Book; To take us Lands away‚Äù. Reading the books, I‚Äôve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings. So much is said about fiction books, so some of you might wonder, what about nonfiction books?</p>
<p>Right. If fiction books are exciting escapes, then non-fiction books are gateways to knowledge. Although I‚Äôm not a big fan of non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. I‚Äôve heard an interesting book mentioned before by a college student. What was different from other books was that the author invited readers to challenge his thoughts and give out their own explanations, encouraging them to think. The whole books sounds interesting and I would‚Äôve read it if I were better at physics.</p>
<p>Read anything. But read it with a different mindset. I don‚Äôt think that a lot of us like the books we are told to read by mandarin teachers, especially for tests. There was once when we were supposed to read How the Steel was Tempered. I didn‚Äôt want to read it. But I got bored one day, so I just took a peek into that book. Okay. I was surprised. The content was completely different from what I thought it was. I actually loved the plot and was amazed at the contributions they did to the revolution. Home Letters by Fu Lei was another book required to read. But I hated it. I didn‚Äôt like how Fu Lei lectured his son, looking all saint and great. It‚Äôs alright. I didn‚Äôt stop read books after this though. I approached books next with a different mindset.</p>
<p>Reading is also a way of making us look at the bigger world out there, communicating thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or even novels can give readers an inside peek of the authors‚Äô wise brain, learning about their encounters, and reflecting such to the world out there. In Educated, I was there, with Westover, watching her grow up. I saw her change from being oppressed by her family issues to a striving girl and graduating from well-known colleges. She changed for the better. But this made me think: how many children are stuck in the mountains, with their family, like her, unable to receive proper education, never able to walk outside, in the city and look at the world? Tara Westover was just one of them, speaking out for the thousands of people like her. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse through the main character sinclair. I saw him during times of confusion, his dirty moves but also his inner struggle, desperate for help. Immediately, I thought of me, trying my best to keep my head above water, walking in the mist, unable to find the path forward. How many of us feels like this? Confused, desperate to find that beacon leading to success. Grab a book, and you‚Äôd be surprised at the themes authors speak of.</p>
<p>According to Herman Hesse, ‚Äúthe more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness ‚Äî at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.‚Äù Books are so much more than what I just mentioned above. They are the crystallization of the world of thoughts, knowledge, of humanity of literally everything you can think of. It‚Äôs amazing how much things can be put in one book waiting for us to devour. But of course, my thoughts don‚Äôt represent the thoughts of everyone. So why not start reading yourself? Don‚Äôt hesitate! Start flipping through the pages, skimming briefly at the content. Anytime, anywhere, read and discover the beauty within. You‚Äôd definitely find something valuable and unexpected.</p>
