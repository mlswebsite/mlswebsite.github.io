    <p>Butterflies. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear it? It could be the butterfly fluttering in the meadow. But for me, it is the butterflies flying in my stomach. So now you might understand why this x-ray picture with butterflies is doing here. This, quite literally, is just having butterflies in your stomach. So why is it here?</p>
<p>Let me just begin with telling you what having ‚Äòbutterflies in your stomach‚Äô means. This describes the nervous energy in your belly before or during situations where you might feel anxious or excited. I hate this feeling, but you see me standing here, which means I have caught some of them (grabs some of it).</p>
<p>My middle school speech competition was still carved in my mind. I wrote my draft and learnt it by heart. While drawing the lot deciding who would go first, I came in second. Standing on the stage, looking at the referees while the coloured lights shone on my face, I could only hear my pounding heart and my brain who ushered me to say something. I couldn‚Äôt remember how I finished, though. I said whatever that immediately came to mind, and stammered my whole way through it. My head was hanging so low when I walked back to class, and I just couldn‚Äôt bear to think how I disappointed my teachers, classmates. They still cheered for me though, I was just being paranoid.</p>
<p>I started to think‚Äî why do I have butterflies in my stomach? Why could the others say and act out everything so confidently while I kept on stammering?</p>
<p>Whenever I look down from the stage, the pitch-black audience, I‚Äôd feel scared. Why? Well, I was near-sighted, so whenever I take off my glasses, I couldn‚Äôt see everyone‚Äôs expressions clearly, only a blurred outline. It might be my own mind, but the audiences‚Äô faces seemed to transform into devilish grinning faces, waiting for me to make a joke of myself and laugh in my face after failure. My mind seemed to be surrounded with laughter, mockery, making my whole head blank and filled with worriedness. My true words were supressed and buried, and everything I said sounded so silly.</p>
<p>How exactly can we get over stage fright and improve our confidence? That is a good question. I‚Äôm curious too, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt think that I have the exact answer. But I‚Äôd like to share my thoughts and hope you‚Äôd get inspired. There was this time when I had to speak in front of the class, and I was frightened. In my perspective, I did poorly. I was stammering, afraid to make eye contact and I kept forgetting my words, improvising as I went along. When I asked my friends how I did, they said I did well. I asked ‚ÄúI felt so nervous up there, couldn‚Äôt you feel it?‚Äù But they responded ‚Äúyou seemed so confident up there. You did great!‚Äù I gaped at their words. Were my wobbly legs, sweaty hands and pounding heart all an illusion? That‚Äôs when I realized it. It wasn‚Äôt. I felt it, real and true, but it wasn‚Äôt apparent in other people‚Äôs perspectives. Perhaps we‚Äôre all making a big deal of ourselves, especially the way we look in other people‚Äôs eyes. Was it, was it even possible in the slightest way that other contestants are just as awkward and nervous as me?</p>
<p>If I was this scared, why would I go on stage and give a speech? Perhaps this was just a ritual of saying goodbye to the old, scared me. Perhaps I still haven‚Äôt got over stage fright, but, hey, at least I took a step forward. Awkward as it is, I finally managed to speak my thoughts out to all of you, and that‚Äôs enough. Could I regret this? I might.</p>
<p>But whatever we choose we are held responsible for it. No matter what the difficulty is, just brave it out and you‚Äôll manage. The butterflies still appear in my stomach whenever I do something that gets me nervous, but I‚Äôm going to catch it, even if it means I have to do things I shrink from.</p>
