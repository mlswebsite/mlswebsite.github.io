    <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it&rsquo;s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>While I was scrolling through movies, I came across Ender‚Äôs game. I haven‚Äôt read the book before, so my reviews are only on the movie and some comments and reviews others had on the book. The movie was about people training an army used to fight the Formics (sort of like ants), and Ender was the main character who‚Äôs destined to lead the team into winning the war. Personally, I believe that it was a good movie, although there were parts that I was confused with or could be better.</p>
<p>The quote at the start of the movie provided me a new perspective on our relationship with others. When you fight your enemy, you do everything to understand them in order to win them. I guess that‚Äôs why people say the feeling hate lasts longer than love? Only if you hate somebody do you consider them as your enemy, and in order to win your enemy, you learn everything, from their names to their favourite song they‚Äôd like to hear when they get sad. When you learn their beliefs, you acknowledge them as a person, as an independent person shaped by their own experiences, modelled by their faith and values.  I guess this quote also foreshadows what happened later in the movie, as when Ender is trained to fight more and more he starts wondering about the Formics. He wonders whether they could talk, communicate, or hold values similar to people on the earth. After the final battle, when he realizes that he has wiped out the entire species, he realizes his mistake. He sees himself as a killer, a merciless weapon only trained for war without actually wondering what the Formics want. In the end, he takes the eggs (ones that survived) always on his fleet, in search of a suitable planet for raising them up.</p>
<p>It was a great movie, especially the part where the teams battled against each other was exhilarating to watch. However, Ender seemed to much of a ‚Äòchosen one‚Äô. To be honest, I‚Äôm pretty tired of the plot where the whole planet believes in the fact that the chosen one, the protagonist, is capable of saving them and their whole life depends on him/her. It makes the character seem more or less bland, as the something special they have makes them successful at almost everything, lacking development and growth. Ender has a development, but I just don‚Äôt think that it was really large. Growing up, Ender has felt pressure and tried to achieve as much as he can in order to make his family proud. His brother, Peter has been removed out of school for being violent, and his sister, Valentine was too compassionate to go into battle school. Growing up as a third child, he had the violence of his brother but was also compassionate. As his personality had a mix of both, I don‚Äôt really think that there was much of a character development, as his acts for example, staying with the commander picking on him or helping the Formic eggs find a new home seem reasonable enough. I saw the pressure he faced but I don‚Äôt think I get why he felt pressured (expect he had great responsibility), so I think a highlight of the psychological conflicts he faced would probably suit me better. The characters didn‚Äôt really resonate with me, which could be improved.</p>
<p>It seemed heavy when the strategoes (or whatever they‚Äôre called) more or less made Ender responsible for the mistake of genocide (even though they might not believe that it was a mistake). It also felt like a blow witnessing the death of the Formics, even if they were our enemies. Although I was confused with the relationship between people on Earth and the Formics, because it seemed like people on earth demanded revenge or safety but then we discovered that they never meant harm?  Then why did the Formics attack in the first place?</p>
<p>I liked the setting of this story, but I do think there could be more clarifications on some parts of the movie, which I do think that it would be better if I read the book. Although so, some say that the book wasn‚Äôt that well, so I guess I should find out.</p>
