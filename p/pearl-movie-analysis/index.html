    <p>She is highly sympathetic yet also disturbingly unhinged. She‚Äôs trapped in a suffocating environment after the first world war, burdened with caring for her paralyzed father and living under her mother‚Äôs strict authority. Yet she dreams to be a star- a dancer that will one day famous, like such in the Hollywood movies.
At the beginning of the film, Pearl admires herself in the mirror. She believes that the image in the mirror (her ideal self) is the sweet, glamorous movie star (yet the role is acutally shaped by the American Dream). It kinda feels like ‚Äòthe mirror stage‚Äô Lacan mentioned. During this stage, infants recognize themselves in the mirror. The reflected self appears whole and unified, but the actual self is fragmented and uncoordinated. From this gap, the infant constructs an ‚Äòideal ego,‚Äô a seemingly complete and coherent self-image. Pearl believes that herself in the mirror is a star, yet it is found on misrecognition, as Pearl can never become the cinematic ideal she chases.  She refuses to believe it, yet her mother‚Äôs words and her failed audition keeps reminding her that she never will become the Hollywood star she imagines herself to be.</p>
<p>We can then identify her violent outbursts as an act to defend herself from her impossible pursuit. Each person she killed represents a different facet of the obstacles to her desired image.</p>
<p>The first person she killed, the projectionist, tells her about a life free from constraints at first. He represents freedom, possibility, and encourages her by telling her she is deemed to become an actor. Yet when the projectionist sees her home, he starts questioning her ‚Äòidentity‚Äô (Pearl‚Äôs house did seem really creepy, I felt like he was scared that she was a psycho) and tries to leave. She then kills him, and screams ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not leaving me‚Äô (or something similar)- which I think means that she can‚Äôt bear seeing the projectionist, symbolizing ‚Äòpossibility and freedom‚Äô run away from her. It feels as if the projectionist has ‚Äòbetrayed‚Äô her, encouraging to ‚Äògrant‚Äô her freedom yet running away the second her sees the ‚Äòreal‚Äô her, and her response to this betrayal was killing him.</p>
<p>Moving onto her family, she has a paralyzed father and a strict mother. I do understand her mother‚Äôs concerns about her auditioning, as they are German immigrants living in the US after the first world-war, which does not add on to the ‚Äòall-American‚Äô standard the judges look for. Her mother is sympathetic when seen as a woman who has endured similar struggles, yet her strictness and constant repression burdens Pearl, pushing her into rebellion, which results in brutal fights (and yes, she was pushed into the fire by Pearl). Unlike the projectionist, her father is an exaggerated visual representation of how trapped Pearl feels, by her family as he can‚Äôt be left alone, he has to be cared for, and by her town since they live on an isolated farm. Her family feels like a cage, a burden that physically and mentally traps her, and her way of dealing with such burden would be murdering them.
Her relationship with her cousin, Mitsy, is also interesting as Mitsy is the exact type of person Hollywood looks for: blonde, and a typical all-American sweetheart.</p>
<p>After the audition, Mitsy brings a devastated Pearl back home and attempts to console her. When Pearl asks if Mitsy got the role, Mitsy first denies it but then admits the truth. At this point, whether Mitsy actually got the role doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîthe important thing is that Pearl believes she did. When she was killing Mitsy, I think there could be two ways of interpretation, one being she‚Äôs jealous of Mitsy, so when she kills her it‚Äôs an image she‚Äôs killing, the image that the world prefers over herÔºåor it could also represent the reality her mother was taunting her (the world‚Äôs view on her instability) with- so she‚Äôs killing her because she‚Äôs afraid of the fear coming true.
In a way, violence has become a way Pearl uses to force her fragmented reality into alignment with her fantasy.</p>
<p>Pearl is a great movie that could be interpreted in so many ways. It is a tragic and horrific story that moulds Pearl into a great character with a disturbing yet deep human complexity.</p>
