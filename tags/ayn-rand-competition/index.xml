        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique Francon loves Roark, yet she struggles to destroy his career. Why? What does she come to understand over the course of the novel that ultimately convinces her to change her mind? How does this conflict of hers relate to the novel’s theme and meaning? In your answer, refer to both The Fountainhead and “Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition” of The Fountainhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique is a conflicted character that pursues her idealism yet is confined to the world by her pessimism. She loves Roark, because he embodies everything she values: greatness, purity, desire, and freedom from social constraints. Dominique admires his greatness, although it is for the same reason that she attempts to destroy his career. She believes that greatness is doomed to fail, to be corrupted by the mediocre, so that’s why she destroys his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her destruction of Roark’s career cannot be considered as betrayal or conflict- it is protection. She destroys his career for a similar reason she chooses to destroy that statue during the conversation with Scarret. She acknowledges that what she loves is pure, but she doesn’t want the mediocre to taint it, so she smashes the statue as an act of protection. She chooses to take clients away from Roark in a way of protection- she believes that in doing so, Roark will ‘belong’ to her. Roark’s integrity will be preserved, he will be untainted from the corrupt world, like the statue. However, she doesn’t take things away from him fundamentally, she merely takes out clients who is unworthy of his work: ones who are easily swayed by popular opinion, who cannot stay true to themselves or acknowledge what they want. Like that statue, she can’t bear Roark turning famous and falling into the hands of mediocrity, so she attempts to destroy Roark in order to protect him from the society. Even though she loves and supports Roark, her actions reflect her belief that the world will also corrupt the ideal, and destruction is the only way to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the novel, Dominique gradually realize that her fundamental belief is incorrect. Even though she tries to take clients away from Roark, she still sees him take commissions, and understand that she cannot fully destroy greatness, greatness is not doomed to be corrupt by the mediocre. Her transformation begins when she helps Roark blow up Cortlandt Homes. When Roark faces trial, she comes to understand that no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way of greatness, it does not shake the core fundamentally, it will matter ‘only to a certain point’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key moment comes when she and Gail Wynand defends Roark in The Banner. As public backlash grows, Wynand caves in to pressure, ultimately sacrificing Roark in order to keep The Banner. Dominique sees that Wynand, despite his power, is still controlled by the world. At this point, Dominique truly realizes that earth has no other meaning than a ‘mere background’- Wynand could choose to ignore such voices and close The Banner, yet he chooses to comply to the society’s demands. Dominique finally sees that it is Roark who is truly free: his ignorance of the world makes him free, because he isn’t attached to gain society’s approval. Witnessing, and fully understanding Roark’s independence, Dominique sees that greatness cannot be doomed- it is indestructible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Roark, she chooses to pursue happiness in her life, to appreciate greatness and embrace her ideals fully. She no longer tries to punish herself nor destroy Roark, she stands together with Roark before the trial on Cortlandt Homes ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique&amp;rsquo;s conflict and development reflects the battle of individualism and
collectivism. At the start of the novel, Dominique is torn between the belief that greatness
cannot win and the appreciation of beauty. Her pursuit for her ideals reflect the strive for
greatness- what Rand calls &amp;lsquo;man-worship&amp;rsquo;, trying to free herself from the world. Yet her
attempts in sabotaging Roark&amp;rsquo;s career and denying her of happiness reflects her belief that
greatness is doomed to fail in a corrupt world. By attempting to destroy Roark&amp;rsquo;s career
through taking his clients, she unintentionally treats Roark&amp;rsquo;s success dependent through
measures of the society (material wealth and power). She tries to confine Roark by
excluding her from the society, rid of commissions, however, she cannot grasp that the
strength of Roark lies precisely in his refusal to seek validation from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Dominique&amp;rsquo;s journey portrays how individualism overcomes collectivism. She begins by unconsciously relying on society&amp;rsquo;s judgements to justify her despair, but she ends by detaching from those judgements entirely. When she recognizes that greatness can lead to success in the world by ignoring the voice of society, she realizes that she is truly free. She too, detaches from the world when she comes to stand with Roark before the trial ends, pursuing her ideals and truly finding happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique’s arc also reflects the triumph of the individual, the process of mankind morphing into a noble soul. Rand writes that The Fountainhead is about presenting the ideal man- independent, detached from social pressures, and respects themselves. Dominique experiences such revolution when she witnesses Roark ‘hold on and move on’ during societal pressure, unable to be corrupted by the mediocre. Dominique is one of the people who Rand quotes in her introduction, referring to as those who ‘grasps and achieve the full reality of man’s proper stature’. Through Roark, Dominique learns that the individual –when truly independent- can triumph. Her transformation reflects Rand’s belief in the power of human greatness, and her revelation embodies the victory of the ideal man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does she try to destroy roark? (prevent roark from being destroyed- takes clients away from him, yet doesn’t take things fundamentally)
Keating is what the society values
Tries to stop roark, yet realizes he’s getting things done anyway.
Stofordd lawsuit- back from marrying people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her fundamental perspective is incorrect- greatness is not doomed to be destroyed. She see Roark still succeed – ignorance of the world. Fundamentally independent of other worlds
Gail wynand – thoughts he rules the world yet he’s still dependent on the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does she like the feeling of being dominated by roark?
Hates roark- feels desire for him, yet she feels tied to the world.
Why do they keep their relationship a secret&amp;mdash;- to the question- why does she try to destroy him? (protection?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tries to do so as a denfence for roark- believes in doing so Roark will belong to her (the pureness in the world is for her to enjoy and secluded by others)
Ignorance feels like a solution
Why is she determined to make herself suffer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful for the opportunity to read her books. Although I don’t fully agree with Rand’s philosophy, her books had pushed me to think. I can relate to Dominique’s pain as I also feel pain in my conflicting mind- Ayn Rand’s works and thoughts are inspiring, while I try my best to comprehend those, I also work hard to try to grasp her loop holes and criticize her reasoning. Rand encouraged me to think, and also brought a whole new perspective in understanding myself and the world, which I appreciate a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the contest sponsors for giving me such a valuable place to discuss my ideas and thoughts on the book. I’m truly grateful for the resources they gave me and how well it made me grow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition Many people have asked me how I feel about the fact that The Fountainhead has been in print for twenty-five years. I cannot say that I feel anything in particular, except a kind of quiet satisfaction. In this respect, my attitude toward my writing is best expressed by a statement of Victor Hugo: &amp;ldquo;If a writer wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain writers, of whom I am one, do not live, think or write on the range of the moment. Novels, in the proper sense of the word, are not written to vanish in a month or a year. That most of them do, today, that they are written and published as if they were magazines, to fade as rapidly, is one of the sorriest aspects of today&amp;rsquo;s literature, and one of the clearest indictments of its dominant esthetic philosophy: concrete-bound, journalistic Naturalism which has now reached its dead end in the inarticulate sounds of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longevity-predominantly, though not exclusively-is the prerogative of a literary school which is virtually non-existent today: Romanticism. This is not the place for a dissertation on the nature of Romantic fiction, so let me state&amp;ndash;for the record and for the benefit of those college students who have never been allowed to discover it&amp;ndash;only that Romanticism is the conceptual school of art. It deals, not with the random trivia of the day, but with the timeless, fundamental, universal problems and values of human existence. It does not record or photograph; it creates and projects. It is concerned&amp;ndash;in the words of Aristotle&amp;ndash;not with things as they are, but with things as they might be and ought to be.
And for the benefit of those who consider relevance to one&amp;rsquo;s own time as of crucial importance, I will add, in regard to our age, that never has there been a time when men have so desperately needed a projection of things as they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to imply that I knew, when I wrote it, that The Fountainhead would remain in print for twenty-five years. I did not think of any specific time period. I knew only that it was a book that ought to live. It did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that I knew it over twenty-five years ago&amp;ndash;that I knew it while The Fountainhead was being rejected by twelve publishers, some of whom declared that it was &amp;ldquo;too intellectual,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;too controversial&amp;rdquo; and would not sell because no audience existed for it&amp;ndash;that was the difficult part of its history; difficult for me to bear. I mention it here for the sake of any other writer of my kind who might have to face the same battle&amp;ndash;as a reminder of the fact that it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of its history without mentioning the man who made it possible for me to write it: my husband, Frank O&amp;rsquo;Connor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a play I wrote in my early thirties, Ideal, the heroine, a screen star, speaks for me when she says: &amp;ldquo;I want to see, real, living, and in the hours of my own days, that glory I create as an illusion. I want it real. I want to know that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too. Or else what is the use of seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? A spirit, too, needs fuel. It can run dry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank was the fuel. He gave me, in the hours of my own days, the reality of that sense of life, which created The Fountainhead&amp;ndash;and he helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion. The essence of the bond between us is the fact that neither of us has ever wanted or been tempted to settle for anything less than the world presented in The Fountainhead. We never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is in me any touch of the Naturalistic writer who records &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; dialogue for use in a novel, it has been exercised only in regard to Frank. For instance, one of the most effective lines in The Fountainhead comes at the end of Part II, when, in reply to Toohey&amp;rsquo;s question: &amp;ldquo;Why don&amp;rsquo;t you tell me what you think of me?&amp;rdquo; Roark answers: &amp;ldquo;But I don&amp;rsquo;t think of you.&amp;rdquo; That line was Frank&amp;rsquo;s answer to a different type of person, in a somewhat similar context. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re casting pearls without getting even a pork chop in return,&amp;rdquo; was said by Frank to me, in regard to my professional position. I gave that line to Dominique at Roark&amp;rsquo;s trial.
I did not feel discouragement very often, and when I did, it did not last longer than overnight. But there was one evening, during the writing of The Fountainhead, when I felt so profound an indignation at the state of &amp;ldquo;things as they are&amp;rdquo; that it seemed as if I would never regain the energy to move one step farther toward &amp;ldquo;things as they ought to be.&amp;rdquo; Frank talked to me for hours, that night. He convinced me of why one cannot give up the world to those one despises. By the time he finished, my discouragement was gone; it never came back in so intense a form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been opposed to the practice of dedicating books; I had held that a book is addressed to any reader who proves worthy of it. But, that night, I told Frank that I would dedicate The Fountainhead to him because he had saved it. And one of my happiest moments, about two years later, was given to me by the look on his face when he came home, one day, and saw the page-proofs of the book, headed by the page that stated in cold, clear, objective print: To Frank O&amp;rsquo;Connor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked whether I have changed in these past twenty-five years. No, I am the same&amp;ndash;only more so. Have my ideas changed? No, my fundamental convictions, my view of life and of man, have never changed, from as far back as I can remember, but my knowledge of their applications has grown, in scope and in precision. What is my present evaluation of The Fountainhead? I am as proud of it as I was on the day when I finished writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? Here, I shall quote from The Goal of My Writing, an address I gave at Lewis and Clark College, on October 1, 1963: &amp;ldquo;This is the motive and purpose of my writing; the projection of an ideal man. The portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate literary goal, as an end in itself&amp;ndash;to which any didactic, intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means. &amp;quot;
Let me stress this: my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers&amp;hellip;My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark [or the heroes of Atlas Shrugged] as an end in himself&amp;hellip;
&amp;ldquo;I write&amp;ndash;and read&amp;ndash;for the sake of the story&amp;hellip;My basic test for any story is: &amp;lsquo;Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself?&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man, I had to define and present the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires. Since man&amp;rsquo;s character is the product of his premises, I had to define and present the kinds of premises and values that create the character of an ideal man and motivate his actions; which means that I had to define and present a rational code of ethics. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to present the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to exist and to function&amp;ndash;a free, productive, rational system which demands and rewards the best in every man, and which is, obviously, laissez-faire capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy is an end in itself, neither in life nor in literature. Only Man is an end in himself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any substantial changes I would want to make in The Fountainhead? No&amp;ndash;and, therefore, I have left its text untouched. I want it to stand as it was written. But there is one minor error and one possibly misleading sentence which I should like to clarify, so I shall mention them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error is semantic: the use of the word &amp;ldquo;egotist&amp;rdquo; in Roark&amp;rsquo;s courtroom speech, while actually the word should have been &amp;ldquo;egoist.&amp;rdquo; The error was caused by my reliance on a dictionary which gave such misleading definitions of these two words that &amp;ldquo;egotist&amp;rdquo; seemed closer to the meaning I intended (Webster&amp;rsquo;s Daily Use Dictionary, 1933). (Modern philosophers, however, are guiltier than lexicographers in regard to these two terms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibly misleading sentence is in Roark&amp;rsquo;s speech: &amp;ldquo;From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man&amp;ndash;the function of his reasoning mind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of religion or religious ideas. I remember hesitating over that sentence, when I wrote it, and deciding that Roark&amp;rsquo;s and my atheism, as well as the overall spirit of the book, were so clearly established that no one would misunderstand it, particularly since I said that religious abstractions are the product of man&amp;rsquo;s of man&amp;rsquo;s mind, not of supernatural revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an issue of this sort should not be left to implications. What I was referring to was not religion as such, but a special category of abstractions, the most exalted one, which, for centuries, had been the near-monopoly of religion: ethics&amp;ndash;not the particular content of religious ethics, but the abstraction &amp;ldquo;ethics,&amp;rdquo; the realm of values, man&amp;rsquo;s code of good and evil, with the emotional connotations of height, uplift, nobility, reverence, grandeur, which pertain to the realm of man&amp;rsquo;s values, but which religion has arrogated to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same meaning and considerations were intended and are applicable to another passage of the book, a brief dialogue between Roark and Hopton Stoddard, which may be misunderstood if taken out of context: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a profoundly religious man, Mr. Roark&amp;ndash;in your own way. I can see that in your buildings.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;That&amp;rsquo;s true,&amp;rsquo; said Roark.&amp;rdquo; In the context of that scene, however, the meaning is clear: it is Roark&amp;rsquo;s profound dedication to values, to the highest and best, to the ideal, that Stoddard is referring to (see his explanation of the nature of the proposed temple). The erection of the Stoddard Temple and the subsequent trial state the issue explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to a wider issue which is involved in every line of The Fountainhead and which has to be understood if one wants to understand the causes of its lasting appeal. Religion&amp;rsquo;s monopoly in the field of ethics has made it extremely difficult to communicate the emotional meaning and connotations of a rational view of life. Just as religion has preempted the field of ethics, turning morality against man, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language, placing them outside this earth and beyond man&amp;rsquo;s reach. &amp;ldquo;Exaltation&amp;rdquo; is usually taken to mean an emotional state evoked by contemplating the supernatural. &amp;ldquo;Worship&amp;rdquo; means the emotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man. &amp;ldquo;Reverence&amp;rdquo; means the emotion of a sacred respect, to be experienced on one&amp;rsquo;s knees. &amp;ldquo;Sacred&amp;rdquo; means superior to and not-to-be-touched-by any concerns of man or of this earth. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But such concepts do name actual emotions, even though no supernatural dimension exists; and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling, without the self-abasement required by religious definitions. What, then, is their source or referent in reality? It is the entire emotional realm of man&amp;rsquo;s dedication to a moral ideal. Yet apart from the man-degrading aspects introduced by religion, that emotional realm is left unidentified, without concepts, words or recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is this highest level of man&amp;rsquo;s emotions that has to be redeemed from the murk of mysticism and redirected at its proper object: man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this sense, with this meaning and intention, that I would identify the sense of life dramatized in The Fountainhead as man-worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an emotion that a few&amp;ndash;a very few&amp;ndash;men experience consistently; some men experience it in rare, single sparks that flash and die without consequences; some do not know what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives as frantically virulent spark-extinguishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not confuse &amp;ldquo;man-worship&amp;rdquo; with the many attempts, not to emancipate morality from religion and bring it into the realm of reason, but to substitute a secular meaning for the worst, the most profoundly irrational elements of religion. For instance, there are all the variants of modern collectivism (communist, fascist, Nazi, etc.), which preserve the religious-altruist ethics in full and merely substitute &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rdquo; for God as the beneficiary of man&amp;rsquo;s self-immolation. There are the various schools of modern philosophy which, rejecting the law of identity, proclaim that reality is an indeterminate flux ruled by miracles and shaped by whims&amp;ndash; not God&amp;rsquo;s whims, but man&amp;rsquo;s or &amp;ldquo;society&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo; These neo-mystics are not man-worshipers; they are merely the secularizers of as profound a hatred for man as that of their avowedly mystic predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cruder variant of the same hatred is represented by those concrete-bound, &amp;ldquo;statistical&amp;rdquo; mentalities who&amp;ndash;unable to grasp the meaning of man&amp;rsquo;s volition&amp;ndash;declare that man cannot be an object of worship, since they have never encountered any specimens of humanity who deserved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see man&amp;rsquo;s highest potential and strive to actualize it. The man-haters are those who regard man as a helpless, depraved, contemptible creature&amp;ndash;and struggle never to let him discover otherwise. It is important here to remember that the only direct, introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the essential division between these two camps is: those dedicated to the exaltation of man&amp;rsquo;s self-esteem and the sacredness of his happiness on earth&amp;ndash;and those determined not to allow either to become possible. The majority of mankind spend their lives and psychological energy in the middle, swinging between these two, struggling not to allow the issue to be named. This does not change the nature of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best way to communicate The Fountainhead&amp;rsquo;s sense of life is by means of the quotation which had stood at the head of my manuscript, but which I removed from the final, published book. With this opportunity to explain it, I am glad to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed it, because of my profound disagreement with the philosophy of its author, Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic and an irrationalist. His metaphysics consists of a somewhat &amp;ldquo;Byronic&amp;rdquo; and mystically &amp;ldquo;malevolent&amp;rdquo; universe; his epistemology subordinates reason to &amp;ldquo;will,&amp;rdquo; or feeling or instinct or blood or innate virtues of character. But, as a poet, he projects at times (not consistently) a magnificent feeling for man&amp;rsquo;s greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of the quotation I had chosen. I could not endorse its literal meaning: it proclaims an indefensible tenet&amp;ndash;psychological determinism. But if one takes it as a poetic projection of an emotional experience (and if, intellectually, one substitutes the concept of an acquired &amp;ldquo;basic premise&amp;rdquo; for the concept of an innate &amp;ldquo;fundamental certainty&amp;rdquo;), then that quotation communicates the inner state of an exalted self-esteem&amp;ndash;and sums up the emotional consequences for which The Fountainhead provides the rational, philosophical base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is not the works, but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank&amp;ndash;to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning,&amp;ndash;it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost.&amp;ndash;The noble soul has reverence for itself.&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; (Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view of man has rarely been expressed in human history. Today, it is virtually nonexistent. Yet this is the view with which&amp;ndash;in various degrees of longing, wistfulness, passion and agonized confusion&amp;ndash;the best of mankind&amp;rsquo;s youth start out in life. It is not even a view, for most of them, but a foggy, groping, undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness. It is a sense of enormous expectation, the sense that one&amp;rsquo;s life is important, that great achievements are within one&amp;rsquo;s capacity, and that great things lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not in the nature of man&amp;ndash;nor of any living entity&amp;ndash;to start out by giving up, by spitting in one&amp;rsquo;s own face and damning existence; that requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man. Some give up at the first touch of pressure; some sell out; some run down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire, never knowing when or how they lost it. Then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning one&amp;rsquo;s mind; security, of abandoning one&amp;rsquo;s values; practicality, of losing self-esteem. Yet a few hold on and move on, knowing that that fire is not to be betrayed, learning how to give it shape, purpose and reality. But whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek a noble vision of man&amp;rsquo;s nature and of life&amp;rsquo;s potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few guideposts to find. The Fountainhead is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the cardinal reasons of The Fountainhead&amp;rsquo;s lasting appeal: it is a confirmation of the spirit of youth, proclaiming man&amp;rsquo;s glory, showing how much is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of man&amp;rsquo;s proper stature&amp;ndash;and that the rest will betray it. It is those few that move the world and give life its meaning&amp;ndash;and it is those few that I have always sought to address. The rest are no concern of mine; it is not me or The Fountainhead that they will betray: it is their own souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AYN RAND New York, May 1968&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the “Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition” of The Fountainhead (which you can find at the very beginning on your copy of The Fountainhead). Judging from that ‘Introduction,’ what factor(s) motivate and enable some people to hold on to their ideals — even in circumstances that seem hostile to them? Support your answer with examples from that ‘Introduction.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who hold on to their ideals in hostile circumstances are motivated by their unwavering self-belief and enabled by their autonomy. In the introduction, Rand recalls being rejected by 12 publishers; however, she insists that her book was one that ‘ought to live’, driving her persistence, eventually gaining wide acclaim for her book. Rand’s enduring faith in her book was her driving force. Yet such perseverance can only be sustained by her independence - rejecting external authority. Rand criticizes religion for monopolizing emotions towards the supernatural, and degrading humanity, arguing that these emotions should be redirected toward man’s own strive for greatness rather than the greater good or God. Quoting Nietzsche, ‘the noble sole has reverence for itself’, Rand claims that individuals who are noble do not rely on validation from the society, but rather from their internal conviction. Rand’s protagonist, Howard Roark, is considered as noble, because he honors his work and do not compromise for others. He chooses to work for little to no pay rather than conform his architectural design to the public taste. The rejection of compromising illustrates how self-autonomy liberates individuals from the pressure of others. Rand’s claims ‘only Man is an end in himself’, rejecting religious and collectivist demands on self-sacrifice, focusing more on individual autonomy. By rejecting external perspectives, individuals shield themselves from pressures to conform and remain true to their inner selves and beliefs. In conclusion, the ability to maintain ideals against hostility stems from independence, avoiding to conform with external pressures, and is motivated by the faith in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her enduring belief in her book is what motivates her and keeps her going, even in harsh circumstances like unable to publish her books, she eventually makes them happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He rose, beamed and held Dominique&amp;rsquo;s hand. “Thought I&amp;rsquo;d drop in on my way home,” he said. “I&amp;rsquo;ve got something to tell you. How did it go, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I expected it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tore her hat off and threw it down on the first chair in sight. Her hair slanted in a flat curve across her forehead and fell in a straight line to her shoulders; it looked smooth and tight, like a bathing cap of pale, polished metal. She walked to the window and stood looking out over the city. She asked without turning: “What did you want to tell me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvah Scarret watched her pleasurably. He had long since given up any attempts beyond holding her hand when not necessary or patting her shoulder; he had stopped thinking of the subject, but he had a dim, half-conscious feeling which he summed up to himself in the words: You never can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ve got good news for you, child,” he said. “I&amp;rsquo;ve been working out a little scheme, just a bit of reorganization, and I&amp;rsquo;ve figured where I&amp;rsquo;ll consolidate a few things together into a Women&amp;rsquo;s Welfare Department. You know, the schools, the home economics, the care of babies, the juvenile delinquents and all the rest of it&amp;ndash;all to be under one head. And I see no better woman for the job than my little girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you mean me?” she asked, without turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one else but. Just as soon as Gail comes back, I&amp;rsquo;ll get his okay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She turned and looked at him, her arms crossed, her hands holding her elbows. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Alvah. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean, you don&amp;rsquo;t want it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t want it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake, do you realize what an advance that would be?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Toward what?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never said I was planning a career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be running a dinky back-page column forever!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not forever. Until I get bored with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But think of what you could do in the real game! Think of what Gail could do for you once you come to his attention!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no desire to come to his attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But, Dominique, we need you. The women will be for you solid after tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t think so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why, I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered two columns held for a yarn on the meeting and your speech.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached for the telephone and handed the receiver to him. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You&amp;rsquo;d better tell them to kill it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She searched through a litter of papers on a desk, found some typewritten sheets and handed them to him. “Here&amp;rsquo;s the speech I made tonight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced through it. He said nothing, but clasped his forehead once. Then he seized the telephone and gave orders to run as brief an account of the meeting as possible, and not to mention the speaker by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All right,” said Dominique, when he dropped the receiver. “Am I fired?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shook his head dolefully. “Do you want to be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not necessarily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;ll squash the business,” he muttered. “I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it from Gail.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you wish. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Listen, Dominique&amp;ndash;oh I know, I&amp;rsquo;m not to ask any questions&amp;ndash;only why on earth are you always doing things like that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For no reason on earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about that swank dinner where you made certain remarks on this same subject. And then you go and say things like these at a radical meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They&amp;rsquo;re true, though, both sides of it, aren&amp;rsquo;t they?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, sure, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t you have reversed the occasions when you chose to express them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been any point in that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Was there any in what you&amp;rsquo;ve done?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No. None at all. But it amused me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can&amp;rsquo;t figure you out, Dominique. You&amp;rsquo;ve done it before. You go along so beautifully, you do brilliant work and just when you&amp;rsquo;re about to make a real step forward&amp;ndash;you spoil it by pulling something like this. Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps that is precisely why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Will you tell me&amp;ndash;as a friend, because I like you and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in you&amp;ndash;what are you really after?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should think that&amp;rsquo;s obvious. I&amp;rsquo;m after nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spread his hands open, shrugging helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled gaily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is there to look so mournful about? I like you, too, Alvah, and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in you. I even like to talk to you, which is better. Now sit still and relax and I&amp;rsquo;ll get you a drink. You need a drink, Alvah.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She brought him a frosted glass with ice cubes ringing in the silence. “You&amp;rsquo;re just a nice child, Dominique,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course. That&amp;rsquo;s what I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat down on the edge of a table, her hands flat behind her, leaning back on two straight arms, swinging her legs slowly. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, Alvah, it would be terrible if I had a job I really wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, of all things! Well, of all fool things to say! What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just that. That it would be terrible to have a job I enjoyed and did not want to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I would have to depend on you&amp;ndash;you&amp;rsquo;re a wonderful person, Alvah, but not exactly inspiring and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it would be beautiful to cringe before a whip in your hand&amp;ndash;oh, don&amp;rsquo;t protest, it would be such a polite little whip, and that&amp;rsquo;s what would make it uglier. I would have to depend on our boss Gail&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s a great man, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, only I&amp;rsquo;d just as soon never set eyes on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever gives you such a crazy attitude? When you know that Gail and I would do anything for you, and I personally&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s not only that, Alvah. It&amp;rsquo;s not you alone. If I found a job, a project, an idea or a person I wanted&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;d have to depend on the whole world. Everything has strings leading to everything else. We&amp;rsquo;re all so tied together. We&amp;rsquo;re all in a net, the net is waiting, and we&amp;rsquo;re pushed into it by one single desire. You want a thing and it&amp;rsquo;s precious to you. Do you know who is standing ready to tear it out of your hands? You can&amp;rsquo;t know, it may be so involved and so far away, but someone is ready, and you&amp;rsquo;re afraid of them all. And you cringe and you crawl and you beg and you accept them&amp;ndash;just so they&amp;rsquo;ll let you keep it. And look at whom you come to accept.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I&amp;rsquo;m correct in gathering that you&amp;rsquo;re criticizing mankind in general&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, it&amp;rsquo;s such a peculiar thing&amp;ndash;our idea of mankind in general. We all have a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. But actually all we know of it is the people we meet in our lifetime. Look at them. Do you know any you&amp;rsquo;d feel big and solemn about? There&amp;rsquo;s nothing but housewives haggling at pushcarts, drooling brats who write dirty words on the sidewalks, and drunken debutantes. Or their spiritual equivalent. As a matter of fact, one can feel some respect for people when they suffer. They have a certain dignity. But have you ever looked at them when they&amp;rsquo;re enjoying themselves? That&amp;rsquo;s when you see the truth. Look at those who spend the money they&amp;rsquo;ve slaved for&amp;ndash;at amusement parks and side shows. Look at those who&amp;rsquo;re rich and have the whole world open to them. Observe what they pick out for enjoyment. Watch them in the smarter speak-easies. That&amp;rsquo;s your mankind in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to touch it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But hell! That&amp;rsquo;s not the way to look at it. That&amp;rsquo;s not the whole picture. There&amp;rsquo;s some good in the worst of us. There&amp;rsquo;s always a redeeming feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”So much the worse. Is it an inspiring sight to see a man commit a heroic gesture, and then learn that he goes to vaudeville shows for relaxation? Or see a man who&amp;rsquo;s painted a magnificent canvas&amp;ndash;and learn that he spends his time sleeping with every slut he meets?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you want? Perfection?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&amp;ndash;or nothing. So, you see, I take the nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take the only desire one can really permit oneself. Freedom, Alvah, freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You call that freedom?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What if you found something you wanted?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I won&amp;rsquo;t find it. I won&amp;rsquo;t choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I&amp;rsquo;d have to share it with all the rest of you&amp;ndash;and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You know, I never open again any great book I&amp;rsquo;ve read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can&amp;rsquo;t be shared. Not with people like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique, it&amp;rsquo;s abnormal to feel so strongly about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can feel. Or not at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique, my dear,” he said, with earnest, sincere concern, “I wish I&amp;rsquo;d been your “father. What kind of a tragedy did you have in your childhood?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why, none at all. I had a wonderful childhood. Free and peaceful and not bothered too much by anybody. Well, yes, I did feel bored very often. But I&amp;rsquo;m used to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suppose you&amp;rsquo;re just an unfortunate product of our times. That&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve always said. We&amp;rsquo;re too cynical, too decadent. If we went back in all humility to the simple virtues&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alvah, how can you start on that stuff? That&amp;rsquo;s only for your editorials and&amp;hellip;” She stopped, seeing his eyes; they looked puzzled and a little hurt. Then she laughed. “I&amp;rsquo;m wrong. You really do believe all that. If it&amp;rsquo;s actually believing, or whatever it is you do that takes its place. Oh, Alvah! That&amp;rsquo;s why I love you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m doing again right now what I did tonight at the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” he asked, bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Talking as I am talking&amp;ndash;to you as you are. It&amp;rsquo;s nice, talking to you about such things. Do you know, Alvah, that primitive people made statues of their gods in man&amp;rsquo;s likeness? Just think of what a statue of you would look like&amp;ndash;of you nude, your stomach and all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now what&amp;rsquo;s that in relation to?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To nothing at all, darling. Forgive me.” She added: “You know, I love statues of naked men. Don&amp;rsquo;t look so silly. I said statues. I had one in particular. It was supposed to be Helios. I got it out of a museum in Europe. I had a terrible time getting it&amp;ndash;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for sale, of course. I think I was in love with it, Alvah. I brought it home with me.”
“Where is it? I&amp;rsquo;d like to see something you like, for a change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Broken? A museum piece? How did that happen?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I broke it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I threw it down the air shaft. There&amp;rsquo;s a concrete floor below.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you totally crazy? Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So that no one else would ever see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dominique!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She jerked her head, as if to shake off the subject; the straight mass of her hair stirred in a heavy ripple, like a wave through a half-liquid pool of mercury. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, darling. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to shock you. I thought I could speak to you because you&amp;rsquo;re the one person who&amp;rsquo;s impervious to any sort of shock. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. It&amp;rsquo;s no use, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She jumped lightly off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Run on home, Alvah,” she said. “It&amp;rsquo;s getting late. I&amp;rsquo;m tired. See you tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-read the conversation between Dominique Francon and Alvah Scarret in Part I, Chapter XII. Judging by that conversation, why does Dominique choose to destroy the sculpture? Explain your answer using evidence from the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominique destroys the statue because she cannot bear to watch the world corrupt what is pure, revealing her inner conflict between her reverence for the ideal and her refusal to be tied to the world. Dominique’s own words corresponding the broken statue was ‘so no one else would see it’. In Dominique’s view, the statue represents purity and everything Dominique wants (her favourite book, a great career, love, etc.). To attain what she wants, embodied by the statute, she acknowledges that she’d ‘have to depend on the whole world’. This creates conflict with her ideals, as she does not want to do so. She states that humans are ‘all so tied together’, ‘all in a net’. To love something is to need it, and needing it means that she would be ensnared in the tight net doomed to compete with others. It means being vulnerable to the world, ultimately accepting the mediocre and the vulgar to protect what she wants, defiling it and herself. Rather than submitting to vulnerability, she affirms to ‘asking nothing. Depend on nothing’ and ‘expect nothing’. By desiring nothing, she believes she can be untangled from the net, thus achieving freedom. Destroying the statue then becomes an act of protection: only in destruction can she shield herself and it from being corrupted. Dominique’s decision to break the statue encapsulates her attitude towards the world: by eliminating everything she loves, she can grant it freedom. This also points to the underlying conflict in her character- her idealism cannot ground its roots in the world because her pessimism worldview stops her from doing so. To ease her pain between her conflicting views, she chooses destruction. In doing so, she honours what she loves by refusing to let it live in a world she deems unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
