        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the ancient tragedies of Greece to the modern-day downfalls of business tycoons and political leaders, the concept of hubris has served as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked power. The theme hubris was already apparent in Greek tragedies, where it mostly meant disrespecting the gods by not crediting ones’ success or fortune to the gods (Marquez, 2015), often leading to nemesis (divine retribution) and ate (ruin). The meaning of hubris has then evolved into excessive arrogance and over-confidence that leads to self-destruction (Marquez, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen coined the term hubris syndrome to describe how power can distort judgement and behavior, mostly evident in political leaders (2008). As it isn’t a diagnostic category of mental illness, Selten points out that the term still needs further validation since it’s not included in classification systems (2023), but the phenomena it describes is timeless. This syndrome can be observed in literary characters such as Agamemnon and Gatsby. Though written centuries apart, both portray characters whose personality traits lead to their tragic endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon, the first play in the Oresteia trilogy performed in 458 BCE, is one of the greatest works of classical Greek tragedy and explores the tragic downfall of Agamemnon and the revenge of Clytemnestra. Set after the Trojan war, King Agamemnon comes back home to Argos, victorious. Clytemnestra, Agamemnon’s wife, waits for him. She knows that Agamemnon has sacrificed his daughter for favorable winds in order to claim glory that rivals the gods, and harboring deep resentment, plots to kill him in order for revenge. Upon his arrival, Agamemnon further demonstrates his hubris by treading upon a sacred purple carpet, a gesture reserved for the gods, thereby further transgressing the boundaries between mortal and divine. As Cassandra, the prophet, warns him of his tragic fate, Agamemnon ignores her omens. Such disregard sets the stage for his doom as Agamemnon gets killed ultimately by Clytemnestra. His ego makes him believe that he can defy fate and his divine punishment, blinding him from reality and leading him towards death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in 1925, the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby shows a character whose hubris ultimately leads to his downfall. However, while Agamemnon’s defies fate, Gatsby clings to an unattainable dream: the revival of his relationship with Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator, meets Jay Gatsby, his neighbor, a wealthy man living in the West Egg who throws a party in his mansion every Sunday night, hoping to meet Daisy Buchanan once to rekindle their love. He ignores Daisy’s marriage with Tom Buchanan. Although, Daisy ultimately chooses Tom, Gatsby refuses to acknowledge the impossibility of his dream. His willingness to take the blame for Daisy as accidentally kills Myrtle with Gatsby’s car further illustrates his intense attitude towards chasing his dream. Jay Gatsby shows hubris in his relentless pursuit of an unattainable dream with Daisy, and his unyielding belief in his power, his ability, his wealth and status. Gatsby’s tragic ending underscores the consequences of hubris, and suggests that the American Dream, the green light he longs for, is an illusion only achieved by the privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-review&#34;&gt;Literature review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hubris syndrome, or Hubristic syndrome, is broadly investigated as a personality trait disorder. Scholars increasingly contend that hubris significantly influences many decisions by those in power. Diamandis (2018) suggests it is power which leads to such behaviors, manifesting as overconfidence, lack of self-control, and morally wrong actions. Owen agrees, claiming that the hubristic syndrome usually occurs when people hold power for a long time, making them develop an inflated view of their abilities. Owen identifies 13 symptoms characterizing this syndrome, and claims that individuals with a portrayal of over 3- 4 symptoms acquire such syndrome. For the purpose of this research, symptoms are categorized into three principal categories: vanity, overconfidence, and solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanity is an inflated sense of self (Merriam-Webster, 2025). People with such traits tend to base their actions on public perceptions, making decisions based in accordance of how others want to perceive them. Symptom 2 (a preference for taking actions in order to improve their reputation), and 3 (an unreasonable concern with image) directly reflects their occupation with image. Symptoms 1 (viewing the world as a place primarily as an area to seek power and glory), 5 (identifies their motives and outlook identical with the one of the nation) and 6 (tends to talk in third person) demonstrate the desire to create an image of supremacy (Owen, 2008). Excessive confidence is defined as being too confidence in one’s ability or decisions (Merriam-Webster, 2025). This trait involves arrogance, and an inflated sense of one’s judgements and ability, believing one has higher status than others. These symptoms are in accordance with symptom 7 (has excessive confidence of their judgement and disrespects the advice of others), 8 (believes one has supremacy in what they can achieve), and 9 (thinks they’re accountable to a higher power such as god than the public opinion) (Owen, 2008). Overconfidence would lead one to ignore their incompetence (Myers, 2019 ), leading to reckless behavior and ignorance in some problems. This is similar to that of symptoms 10 (exhibits reckless, impulsive and restless behavior),12 (tends to have a ‘broad vision’, making them ignore practical details, costs, and potential negative consequences), and 13(makes these mistakes not due to fault analysis, but due to lack of attention caused by overconfidence) (Owen, 2008). Solitude means the state of being alone from a society (Merriam-Webster, 2025). In this context, it means the isolation of oneself, often becoming detached from reality (symptom 11: loses contact with reality, becoming progressively isolated). People who have a fervent attitude on what they do, shown in symptom 4 (has a fervent attitude on the things they do and tend to have exaltation in manner), tend to further isolate them from society (Owen, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This categorization allows for a systematic analysis of hubristic traits in literary characters, examining how such traits contribute to their eventual downfall. The framework is based on the assumption that prolonged exposure to power fundamentally alters judgment, increasing susceptibility to irrational behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical literature has long examined the theme hubris, with ancient Greek tragedies portraying it as a fatal flaw that leads to severe consequences. Icarus falling to death as the flew too close to the sun (Ovid, 8 CE) demonstrates overconfidence, as he ignores Daedalus’ warnings and tries to defy human limitations. Hubris was also apparent in other works, as Doko described multiple characters such as Beowulf, King Lear, and Gatsby with such characteristics (2021). He claimed that the errors they made, for example, King Lear’s pride blocked him from distinguishing lies and the truth, becomes the reason for their tragic ends. Hidayati explored hubris syndrome in Moby Dick, arguing that Ahab’s reckless pursuit of the whale leads him to the isolation of his crew, leading to their deaths (2021). This confirms Owen’s proposition that Hubris syndrome causes irrational behaviour, leading to his tragic end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gap-and-research-question&#34;&gt;Gap and Research question
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen uses political figures in history such as George W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair to show that the hubris syndrome is applicable in real life (Owen, 2008), while Selten (2023) highlights Napoleon Bonaparte and Mao Zedong as further examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Owen’s work bridges the gap between psychological analysis and historical documentation, helping people understand how the hubris is manifested in real-life contexts. However, his emphasis on political leaders leaves room to explore hubris beyond political history, particularly in literary narratives. Hidayati, Arifuddin (2021) has already inspected its exhibition in only one book- Moby Dick, where the captain of a whale hunting vessel, Ahab portrays hubris syndrome as he constantly seeks down the white sperm whale named Moby Dick. Literature works offer insights in the potential consequences of human behavior, serving as cautionary reflections that deepen our understanding for real life. However, this article remains isolated as other literature articles analyze the theme hubris but not the syndrome. Little research systematically analyzes hubristic traits across multiple literature works in different eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that while hubristic syndrome was not formally defined until the late 20th century, its expressions are clearly evident in historical and literary figures across different eras. Choosing two literature pieces from different eras, this study will examine the presence and impact of hubristic syndrome in two distinct literary figures: Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. This  analysis will explore the specific traits associated with hubristic syndrome, trying to diagnosis the characters of this syndrome and discover how it ultimately contribute to their tragic fates. This study aims to contribute to a broader understanding of how the hubris syndrome manifests across time periods and cultural context, offering a novel application for Owen’s work. Therefore, this research seeks to answer the following question: 1) How do the characteristics of Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby manifest the hubristic syndrome as defined by Owen? 2) To what extent does their downfall illustrate the consequences of this syndrome? While not trying to validate the syndrome clinically, the study tries to provide literary validation and applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this premise, the study hypothesizes that hubristic syndrome was portrayed throughout the two pieces of literature, and served as a key factor in the downfall of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study employs a qualitative content analysis methodology (Miles and Huberman, 1994 ; Krippendorff, 2018) to investigate how hubris is depicted in literature. The primary data sources are Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. These works were selected for their thematic relevance to hubris and their influence on their respective literary traditions. The analysis seeks to identify symptoms that reflect hubristic syndrome, following Owen’s (2008) framework. Given the scope and timeframe of the study, only two pieces of literature were selected, and symptoms were extracted from a few chapters with the appearance of such character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is segmented into units including character trait or significant plot events. The study examines how these behaviors and themes are expressed within the narratives and highlights their implications, including the consequences of these hubris-driven actions. To enhance reliability, a quantitative study was employed in looking at the prevalence of each characteristic in the literature pieces. A quantitative frequency count was conducted in looking at the appearance of each trait. The appearance of symptoms in each event was counted and summed up, utilizing a basic spreadsheet software for data organization. An integration of qualitative interpretation with quantitative data allows for a nuanced understanding of the extent to which characters portray hubris syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Great Gatsby, I looked at the prevalence of each trait in chapter 2-7, where Gatsby appeared. I separated each trait into smaller symptoms, calculating the number of times each trait appeared in each chapter, and added them up to look at the total mentions. The analysis of Gatsby’s portrayal revealed a total of 44 indications of vanity, suggesting a significant emphasis on this trait in his characterization during chapter 2 to chapter 9. The data indicates that Gatsby portrayed the trait vanity most, followed by 17 mentions of excessive confidence and 13 mentions of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Agamemnon, I separated the play into different events according to Agamemnon’s actions or speech. Then I observed what symptoms each event indicated. In total, 6 symptoms were present, suggesting that Agamemnon has the hubris syndrome. With an average of 1.8 identified symptoms of hubris syndrome across the five key events analyzed in Agamemnon (Table 4), the data suggests that manifestations of hubristic traits were not isolated occurrences but rather a consistent element within the play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-vanity&#34;&gt;1. Vanity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanity is a symptom of hubris syndrome, manifesting as a deep, constant obsession with how others perceive the individual. This fixation increases the importance of one’s public persona, which becomes central to their identity. Such individuals view their image as paramount, believing that it must be perfect or associated with high power and wealth in order to achieve superiority. This behavior leads to constant efforts in consolidating their social position, control how others see them, and any perceived threat to this image—such as criticism or failure—may provoke defensive or aggressive reactions. Not only so, individuals start to put emphasis on the voices of others, highly aware of how others would perceive them, thoroughly thinking on how to act to maintain such image (Webster, 2014). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portrayed a great extent of concern with image, Agamemnon as maintaining his image as loyal and obedient to the gods, and Gatsby as maintaining his fake image as the wealthy and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the war, Agamemnon is greeted by Clytemnestra who urges him to step onto the crimson carpets, only greeted by the feet of the gods to step upon (Britannica, 2024). His hesitation upon the offer reveals his anxiety over appearing arrogant in front of the gods and his citizens. He states that only such commodities could only be used on god, politely declining Clytemnestra’s offer. He also refuses with ‘the people murmur, and their voice is great in strength’ (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.938), concerned that his disobedience towards the gods would wreck his image among citizens. Ultimately, he gives in, rationalizing his behavior through Clytemnestra’s suggestion. This uncertainty contrasts sharply with his prior decisiveness during the sacrifice of his daughter, showing an unreasonable concern with image. During the sacrifice, he defiantly issued commands without hesitation and acknowledgment of other people’s thoughts, claiming - “May it be well” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.217). This suggests an inconsistent evaluation of his public image relative to political ambition, making his concerns unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in The Great Gatsby, Gatsby exhibits a relentless commitment in constructing his image of wealth and status. Although originating from a humble origin, he is concerned with his fake image of immense wealth and status to fit into the world of the elite. As he tells Nick, the narrator, of his background, “His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west- all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.70), he puts emphasize on his family wealth and education but the vagueness suggests an intentional fabrication, intended to help him fit into high society. Moreover, he repeatedly emphasizes his image, including his financial status. When Nick questioned his wealth “I thought you inherited your money?” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96), he responds automatically with the narrative below: “I did, old sport” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic- the panic of the war” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96). He instinctively tries to maintain his titled image. Although his response suits the tone of the upperclassmen, it highlights the fragility of his persona. If he inherited his money, he never should’ve needed 3 years to earn it. The contradictions indicate that Gatsby is concerned with image as his entire existence is built around it, making any disruption of his image vulnerable to his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-excessive-confidence&#34;&gt;2. Excessive Confidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive confidence leads to poor decision making as it tends to cause individuals to overestimate their abilities or underestimate the challenges they’re facing. Overconfidence is sometimes beneficial as it boosts morale, ambition and increases one’s competition and survival (Johnson &amp;amp; Fowler, 2011). However, excessive confidence can lead to blindness and may impair self-reflection, making failure a persistent outcome in one’s journey (Hidayati et.al. 2021). Fast asserts that when people experience power, they tend to make overconfident decisions that lead to negative outcomes, or ultimately, personal downfall (2011). Overconfidence can be manifested in three different aspects, 1) in the overplacement of believing one to have superior performance than others, 2) in overpercision regarding the accuracy of one’s judgements, 3) in overestimating one’s performance abilities (Moore &amp;amp; Healy, 2007). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portray this trait, exhibiting unwavering faith in their goals, leading to negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also shows overconfidence in his decision to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. Although Agamemnon experiences internal struggle regarding the sacrifice, he ultimately does so. However, he fails to see the consequences after sacrificing his daughter to secure victory in the Trojan War. Additionally, this act highlights his authority as he is able to extert control over the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once trapped, she wept, called on her father’s name— as if Iphigeneia’s maidish scream could move his crew of genocidophiles, his entourage of death-squads; or move him.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.228)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He commands soldiers to hold Iphiegnia down, asserting his authority while ignoring her pleas of life. His disregards demonstrate his belief in absolute authority, extending to family members, revealing a detachment from moral responsibility and familial compassion. He is confident to assume that he can compel others to participate in this horrific act without consequence. He overestimates his power regarding the lives of his family, since he sees himself as the one who can determine the fate of those around him, including his daughter. He neglects how Clytemnestra thinks, and thus fails to consider the consequences the act would bring to the whole family. “So with relief he gave it Necessity’s name. Once necked in his yoke, though, we smelt off him something unclean, something desanctified, something set free to defile; new look in his face that said All is permitted for me.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.218)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon rationalizes his decision by calling it a necessity, convincing himself that it was inevitable. He aligns such matters with the act of the whole nation, claiming it to be for the sake of war. While he frames his decision for the benefit of the nation, the essence of the war was driven my personal motives in retrieving Helen. As he accepts the sacrifice, he no longer seems bound by moral constraints, as if he now believes he can do anything. This could imply his corrupting nature of power and the moral decay that follows his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence also lies in his conviction that his sacrifice is justified for the sake of victory. His desire of victory, that is, to bring Helen back, to demonstrate the powers of the Greek supersedes the lives of those around him, including his own daughter. The morally questionable decision made by him seems to bring harm as he fails to estimate the moral consequences that would bring him. He sees his vision of the future (victory in Troy) as so important that it justifies any action, including extreme violence, like sacrificing Iphigenia. His reckless behaviour (symptom 10) is portrayed through the chorus elder’s words, “So I won’t try to hide from you, my lord, that when you led your army forth—for Helen— you cut a figure I could not applaud. Your plan seemed ill-conceived and uncompelling: to send an army out to die in war to win back what—a voluntary whore?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.800). The elder exposes a deep skepticism toward the rationale for the Trojan expedition, suggesting that Agamemnon’s actions were perceived as impulsive, irrational, and reckless. This critique implies Agamemnon’s reckless acts, pointing to a broader erosion of confidence in Agamemnon’s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon shows overconfidence through his dismissals of the consequences happening in his palace. He ignores the warnings from Cassandra, the oracle; and he portrays no remorse for his daughter after winning the war. Agamemnon’s greatest threat comes from within his own home. Clytemnestra has spent years plotting his demise, seeking both revenge for Iphigenia and power over Argos. Even when Cassandra warns him of his impending doom, Agamemnon dismisses the danger, assuming that no one in his household would dare challenge him. Upon being struck down, he claims “And now—in my own house—you strike me down?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.1344). The phrase ‘in my house’ further depicts his  surprise; he perceives his household as an extension of his power, not anticipating any disobedience. Ultimately, Clytemnestra’s act dismantles Agamemnon’s belief and illusion in achieving supremacy and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence blinds him from suspecting betrayal and leaves him vulnerable, unable to defend himself when the moment of vengeance arrives. In the end, his overconfidence—his certainty that no one, especially not his wife, could defy him—proves to be his undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Gatsby shows immense confidence in his ability to recreate his relationship with Daisy. He believes that their love has remained unchanged, despite Daisy’s marriage to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby is certain that he could rekindle their love, making him ignore potential limitations. This is portrayed through his words in chapter 6, “‘Repeat the past?’ He cried incredulously, ‘why of course you can!’&amp;hellip; ‘I’m going to fix
everything just the way it was before,’ he said, nodding determinedly, ‘she’ll see.’” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.118).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby’s overconfidence blinds him to Daisy’s divided loyalties. As Nick tells him about Daisy’s attachment with Tom, he refutes with “‘I don’t think she ever loved him.’ Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.137). His refusal to acknowledge Daisy’s past and love life with Tom illustrates his excessive confidence in his judgment and his disregard of the advice of others. His entire faith had been built on the fantasy that Daisy’s love would return to him. However, he was blinded by confidence and failed to account for the gap between reality and fantasy, contributing to his final downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-loneliness&#34;&gt;3. Loneliness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling occurring in a person when one’s social network is too small or lacks emotional closeness. The feeling arises either when one has few friends or when the intimacy of such relationships hasn’t been fulfilled (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). Prolonged loneliness then progresses into isolation, a social condition rather than a feeling. Isolation occurs when an individual feels alone because they are, in fact, disconnected from others—whether due to the absence of relationships or the failure to establish deep emotional bonds. This state of isolation is particularly harmful because it reinforces feelings of helplessness, inadequacy, and emotional emptiness. As Hunt et al. (2017) highlight, prolonged loneliness and isolation can have detrimental effects on a person&amp;rsquo;s physical and mental health, contributing to a weakened immune system, cardiovascular diseases, suicidal behavior and dementia. Loneliness is influenced by various factors, including the quality and availability of relationships, personality traits, societal norms, and an individual&amp;rsquo;s capacity to adjust to changing circumstances (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). This understanding of loneliness can be applied to The Great Gatsby, as Gatsby’s illusion in the American Dream distances himself from society, while Agamemnon doesn’t exhibit significant signs of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon, unlike Gatsby, does not distance himself from reality, nor is he stuck in his illusions. He aspires to win the Trojan War, which results in tangible achievements. He does not have a fervent attitude in trying to achieve any goals. It could be pointed out that he is fervent in trying to attain absolute power and supremacy, particularly in his belief of his power over life and death, but it isn’t depicted much in the text. His pursuit of his goals suggests more of a reliance on his status as a king that supports his execution of orders, rather than using a fervent attitude. This contrasts with Gatsby, who centers his character in a passionate pursuit of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is stuck in his illusions, disassociating himself from reality. He’s stuck in his beliefs, sure that he will attain the American Dream he pursued relentlessly, and that Daisy will come back. The narrator mentioned Gatsby standing at the dock, staring into the distance. He commented, “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.” (Fitzgerald, 1925 p.193). Gatsby is devoted to his dream. He is obsessed, so much that it turns into a symbol of his undying hope, becoming a central part of his identity. He chases it fervently, slowly isolating himself from society. Even with the huge parties he has thrown, he still feels emotionally isolated as nobody truly understands him. This disassociation also appears at the end of the book, where no one comes to his funeral except Nick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of Gatsby’s fervent attitude towards his illusions is when he invites Daisy to afternoon tea. After he asks Daisy to afternoon tea at Nick’s cottage, he looks at the surroundings and ordered for Nick’s grass to be cut. “The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.” (Fitzgerald, 1926, p. 90). While it would be customary to bring a few flowers for such an occasion, Gatsby decides to overwhelm the cottage with an excessive amount of flowers, transforming it into a greenhouse. This reflects his intensity and passion in trying to rekindle his romance with Daisy, aligning with symptom 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.100). Gatsby here shows Daisy around his mansion, while they were standing at the balcony, looking into the green light. During the moment, Gatsby briefly recognizes that his whole identity was based on pursuing the idealized version of Daisy, which was someone who he could never attain. Even the Daisy right beside him was unattainable due to social and personal barriers between them. Nevertheless, instead of accepting this realization, Gatsby chooses to suppress his doubts and continue chasing his vision with even greater intensity. This denial of reality not only illustrates Gatsby’s deepening obsession but also marks the beginning of his progressive isolation, as he increasingly distances himself from the world as it truly is in favor of his unattainable ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the three main traits of hubris syndrome to interpret the characteristics of the Agamemnon and Gatsby; the results show that Agamemnon and Gatsby both portray Hubris syndrome summed up by three main traits: Vanity, Overconfidence and Loneliness. Gatsby fabricates a background of wealth and prestige to maintain his constructed identity. He displays overconfidence in estimating his abilities of winning Daisy back, making him ignore Daisy’s dilemma. His fervent attitude in chasing the American dream makes him isolated. His relentless pursuit of the dream caused Daisy to abandon him and led him to his demise. Agamemnon shows concern with his image as he returns home. He seeks for power and greatness, but he is concerned of vengeance from the gods. He demonstrates overconfidence by killing his daughter, convinced it was a necessary act. He is confident that it’s the right decision, but he is blinded and unaware of the plotting inside the palace to kill him. Although so, he shows little isolation as he didn’t portray exaltation in his actions. His overconfidence and pride eventually led to his death, participating in his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results provide additional support for Owen’s application of Hubris syndrome (2008). The portrayal of Hubris Syndrome by the two characters suggests the recurring presence of such syndrome across fictional portrayals from different periods. Hubris syndrome is related with each of the characters’ tragic endings, suggesting that it could bring detrimental effects if not dealt with carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations-implications-and-further-research&#34;&gt;Limitations, Implications and Further Research
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations that should be considered. First, regarding internal validity, the content analysis was conducted by one person without peer discussions or cross- validation, making interpretations subjective and reducing the consistency of the findings. This also reduces reliability, as interpretations may differ if repeated by other researchers. In addition, the two passages selected were from western literature on male characters, making it not as generalizable to other cultures or gender perspectives, where hubristic traits could vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this still shows that hubris syndrome dominates the plot trajectories, illustrating that hubris syndrome plays a role in one’s tragic ending. Manifestations of the syndrome could also support its broad range of application, even in literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could consider analysing hubristic syndrome in different cultures, for example, eastern culture or females to further broaden the applicability of findings. There could also be in depth interviews or discussions with one or more researchers to enhance the validity and reliability of interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Self Determination Theory</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/self-determination-theory/</link>

        <guid>https://example.com/p/self-determination-theory/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a psychological view, self-determination means the result or process of acting under one’s own choice, ‘particularly to behaviours that improves one’s circumstance’ (APA dictionary of psychology, 2018; Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Self-determination is useful in overcoming fears, giving humans the courage to achieve more, as did Jerry when going through the tunnel (Lessing, 1957), bringing him growth and maturity. For adolescents, or even young children like Jerry, self-determination could help them make vocational decisions, informed choices, and increase independence (Field, Hoffman, Posch 1997). Increased motivation and satisfaction of three fundamental needs also increases self- determination, helping ones to persevere through challenges. Elouise Cobell presents such characteristic when going against the U.S. government, fighting for the rights of the Blackfoot tribe, bringing justice eventually (Janko, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is linked with motivation, which is performed through the fulfilment of three fundamental needs. It is highly valued for the benefit it brings and is becoming increasingly important in our everyday lives. The three fundamental needs, competence, relatedness and autonomy is shown to increase motivation. These are shown to be important since it fosters innovation, engagement, wellbeing and allows us to adapt in the constant change of opportunities. (Souders, 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is a crucial factor in personal growth, as it empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Fulfilling the fundamental needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness fosters motivation, gives rise to self-determination and fosters personal growth. This essay is going to look at self-determination in the aspects of the three fundamental needs and motivation, and its implications in the education context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the self-determination theorem, the concepts of the three fundamental needs should be defined. Autonomy means to have freedom and be in control of one’s own choice, which affirms their inner thoughts (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Being in control of one’s own choices could give out energy, and wholeness, and avoid self-fragmentation, useful in developmental stages (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Relatedness means the need to be connected with others, to feel belonging and responsibility in a group (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Achieving a sense of belonging could be helpful for individuals, gaining support, resources, and attachment (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Competence means how prepared a person is for the task to achieve wanted outcomes (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). According to Deci and Ryan (2010), competence is important because a person willing to learn would be actively seeking knowledge, and open to new cultures and new things, providing them with social interaction or survival, while those with little competence could be ill-prepared for future situations. Each of these needs, positive or negative, are all important to enhance self-determination. Jerry as a character in Lessing’s short story “Through the Tunnel” demonstrates self- determination in going through the tunnel. This is manifested by the three fundamental needs. Jerry experiences a strong desire for social connection which fits the definition of relatedness in the self-determination theory, as evidenced by his isolation from his peers and his yearning to belong to the group of older boys. However, their rejection after he discovers his inability to follow them through the tunnel deepens his sense of isolation. The desire for belonging with the older boys increases fuels his drive and wants to go through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessing highlights Jerry&amp;rsquo;s development of competence through his preparations. He demonstrates initiative by requesting goggles from his mother and practices breath control with such dedication that his nose bleeds. These actions showcase his growing confidence and acquired skills. After gaining the confidence and preparations needed to go through the tunnel, this increases his willingness to do so. Additionally, Jerry exhibits autonomy throughout his endeavor. He makes independent choices, acting without his mother&amp;rsquo;s interference, and ultimately chooses to confront his fear by entering the tunnel on his own volition. This motivates him and moves him towards the act of going through the tunnel. These fundamental factors all enhances motivation, which in turn contributes to his self-determination, giving him the vitality to go through the hole, to continue even if he’s facing obstacles and challenges, and eventually overcome the fear of going through the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory postulates that the satisfaction of the three fundamental needs sustains intrinsic motivation. According to Patall and Cooper ( 2008 ), given the freedom of choice, intrinsic motivation could increase because of the increased willingness to do so. Autonomy fosters intrinsic motivation. This is apparent when students are allowed to participate in activities they find interesting, challenging, or unfamiliar (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Relatedness, gaining support from students, and feeling connected tend to increase motivation (Ryan &amp;amp; Powelston, 1991). Gaining enough satisfaction from peers might foster a sense of belonging, so one might get the sense that doing so again could make them feel the sense of belonging again, making them more determined and increasing their motivation. Although competence beliefs are not shown to be too highly correlated with intrinsic motivation, certain experiences could affect both factors, increasing confidence and interests, and willingness to learn (Spinath &amp;amp; Steinmayr, 2008). As stated by Dysvik and Gagne, one hypothesis was that the needs worked in synergy, and the satisfaction of the two needs, relatedness and autonomy, or autonomy and competence could all enhance intrinsic motivation. Although competence wasn’t a main factor for increasing intrinsic motivation, it acted as an essence for intrinsic motivation (Dysvik &amp;amp; Gagne, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is also reported that autonomous motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, are the bases of self-determination, and promotes self-determination, influencing the well-being and the engagement of individuals (Main, 2023; Deci and Ryan, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with self-determination, autonomous motivation is when a person behaves in a way governed by oneself with internal or integrated motivation. “Intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000), giving oneself more choice and interests in doing something. Integration happens when people adopt a value or regulation by others and believe it, following the rule, believing that it is crucial to their goal or it’s their own choice to do so (Deci, 1994). These two ways of motivation leads individuals to autonomously pursue these values because they are aligned with their personal goals and interests, contributing to autonomous motivation. Elouise Cobell, shows autonomous motivation in standing up for what she believes is right, advocating rights for the Blackfeet tribe (Janko, 2013). The internal sense of justice and control of her rights perhaps fuelled her and motivated her to act. Her connection and belongingness to the tribe could also have been a factor. These intrinsic motivational factors made her continue restlessly for what she did until she passed away. Autonomous motivation has its benefits in other aspects such as gaining psychological wellbeing, continuing a healthy habit, promoting the whole wellbeing of a society (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2012 ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled motivation, on the other hand, is when a person behaves in a way due to external factors or introjection. “Extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome.” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Introjection happens when taking in values from others while not truly internalizing it as one’s own. This could be due to external pressures and could result in feelings such as guilt or anxiety (Deci, 1994). These are shown to lower autonomy, resulting in lowered self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory is applied in multiple aspects such as education, nursing, sports and work. In education, self-determination theory is applied in online learning, teachers and students to research why students are motivated to learn and how to provide a better environment to foster self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multiple researches, the researchers focus on the three basic needs and motivation in education. When the three basic needs of self-determination theory are met, the students are more likely to be engaged in school. Earl reported that students with the highest satisfaction of the three needs experienced the most achievement, engagement and had most positive effects (2019). Autonomous goals and motivation is also an evident factor in education, affecting their behaviours. Guay reports that autonomous motivation results in more positive outcomes, and pursuing autonomous goals could increase motivation, creating a positive cycle for improving education behaviours (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the academic achievements and perseverance of students, programs promoting motivation or fulfilling the three basic needs are encouraged to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting and increasing autonomy is one way. Reeve, develops an experiment where teachers receive training on autonomy support, achieving the answer that the more autonomy given to students by teachers, the more engaged they were (2004). Chiu does something similar with the during the context of online learning, showing that “students feel a stronger sense of autonomy to choose their preferred technologies to learn with, a stronger sense of competence to access online learning, and a stronger sense of relatedness to connect with teachers for communication.”(Chiu, 2021) Chiu’s research also supports the claim that increasing fundamental needs of students could increase their engagement, emphasizing that teachers should fully satisfy the three needs of the students to increase their motivation. Su and Reeve suggest there are a few ways to foster autonomy support such as considering students’ perspectives, avoiding the use of controlling language, encouraging them to solve their problems; giving out instruction manuals, providing knowledge and training to mostly teachers (especially those just beginning their career or not so familiar with fostering self- determination), and a short follow-up after training (2010). Such programs should be encouraged to be implemented because it increases the autonomy of the students, and could be easily done online or offline. Such programs mostly have a positive effect, although the duration is unknown. There are a few limitations in the program, such as the sample size, and it should try to be implemented into more environments, such as home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs focusing on enhancing the needs in different subjects are also experimented. Two programs, the Reading within Family and School program and the CASIS-Écriture training program (cooperation, authentic activities, support for autonomy, involvement, and structure) are used to enhance their reading and writing skills respectively. The first program intervened in school and family environments to encourage reading, to further enhance their curiosity and willingness to read. Through the process, their autonomy and readiness is rising, which leads to the increase of intrinsic motivation. The study showed that intervening highly increased their engagement, having a five-month lasting effect. The second focused on motivation and writing, providing CASIS training courses for teachers. The study showed that trained teachers gave students more autonomous motivation in writing compared with controlled students. Providing extra training in school environments for teachers or giving out a free, supportive environment at home are all useful in promoting motivation, giving rise to self-determination. These subject based researches are useful in increasing motivation for reading and writing, although the CASIS program had a limited increase in children’s autonomous motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;increasing-self-determination&#34;&gt;Increasing self-determination
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deci acknowledges that “providing a rationale, acknowledging feelings, and conveying choice are relevant for promoting internalization” (Deci,1994). From the programs used to implement self-determination, it is inferred that creating an environment where one provides one’s thoughts, gives enough freedom for choice, and acknowledges their feelings values their opinions is crucial. Controlling words should also be minimized. This supports integration and intrinsic motivation, further fuelling self-determination and helping personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only so, but people should also be intent on discovering their basic needs to promote intrinsic motivation. To achieve such needs, allowing oneself the freedom of choice and letting one decide what to do in even the smallest of things, such as what to wear could increase autonomy. Giving oneself a challenge and allowing oneself to learn new skills necessary for the challenge could help increase competence, and creating more connections within the society could increase relatedness, increasing determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academic studies, especially, parents or schools should provide environments that provide little external forces. They should give children more choices, allow children to develop their interests, provide favourable challenges (e.g. speech competitions), and give out positive and constructive feedback. In case there is little intrinsic motivation, parents or schools should also let children understand the values of activities they don’t like, such as providing rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although so, it should be acknowledged that different personalities and cultural beliefs could all shape ones’ behavior, limiting their ability of making decisions (Main, 2023), so implementing the same ways to everyone may not be all effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-determination theory offers a structure for understanding self-determination in personal growth and the roles of the basic needs and motivation. As discussed, self- determination, fueled by autonomous motivation and the fulfillment of core needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their full potential. Using examples from Lessing and Janko, understanding the differences and uses of each motivation, and the connections between these factors, environments that nurture self-determination can be created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Dolly the Sheep to Snuppy the Dog, pet cloning is gaining more attention, and the number of people who are considering using this technique to resurrect their pet is climbing. Since commencing operations in 2015, Viagen, a company specializing in pet cloning, has reported an increase in the number of cloning procedures performed. The company has disclosed completing hundreds of procedures to date (Dimitropoulos, 2022). But is this the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet cloning has its ups and downs. This article evaluates the value it has in a scientific view. To sum it up, the merits of pet cloning are controversial in the scientific community, with the main points of the dispute being the process&amp;rsquo;s efficiency, the long-term health implications for cloned animals, and reprogramming considerations surrounding the SCNT technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inefficient-process&#34;&gt;Inefficient Process
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloning of animals typically utilizes the SCNT (Somatic cell nuclear transfer) technique . The cloning process starts with harvesting the skin cell from the donor animal. The cell is then fused an unfertilized egg removed from the female of the same species with the nucleus (containing DNA) taken away. Fusing the two cells with an electric pulse jump starts cell division, eventually resulting in an embryo. During the early stage, the embryo is impla nted surgically in the surrogate mother. It carries the cloned pregnancies and gives birth to the cloned animal. Though the steps may seem easy, problems occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, cloning has a low success rate. Th e main reason of the l ow success rate could be due to the failure of the development of embryos. In laboratories, only a few cells have developed to become fetuses. After that, “a high rate of fetal, perina tal, and neonatal loss ” is reported (Hare, 2003, p. 271) . Out of the emb ryos implanted into the wombs of 13 sheep, only Dolly survived. (Elsner, 2006) This contributes to the low success rate of cloning, requiring improvements. A low success rate of cloning, supported by Ko’s research, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign ’s College of Veterinary Medicine, claimed that the success rate of cloning dogs is around 20 percent (Brogan, 2018). Although quite high compared with cloning other animals, the success rate still implies that trying to clone 100 dogs could mean failure in the other 80, wasting 80% of the lives of cloned animals. According to Dr. Smith, the reason of low success rat e cou ld be due to the dogs having unique reprodu ctive cycles and involving a considerable number of genes (Brogan, 2018). This requires further research and could be improved until the technology is commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, t he process wastes numerous a nimals, eggs, and embryos. Snuppy, the cloned dog, and his twin came from the three pregnan cies, 1,000 embryos implanted into 123 surrogates. Snuppy and his twin was the outcome of the three pregnancies of more than 1,000 embryos implanted into the 123 sur rogates. Brogan claims, “You need a good number of dogs to do this type of cloning, ” (2018, para. 17) implying that the process is extremely wasteful. Elsner agrees by claiming that with dolly, “the 277 attempts to fuse an adult sheep cell nucleus with an egg, only 27 embryos developed normally for a week.” (2006 , p. 597). This process wastes a tremendous amount of eggs, and embryos, surpassing those in natural reproduction. (Elsner, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;health-and-longevity-p-roblems&#34;&gt;Health and Longevity P roblems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the hardships of turning into a fetus, cloned animals encounter more trouble. Following birth, clon ed offspring might not survive. During the 24h of birth, clones could die due to “ respiratory distress; increased birth weight; or cardiovascular anomalies, some of which have resulted in hypertrophic liver and dilated major blood vessels. ”(Hare, 2003, p.271) The lives of the clone ends abruptly , just after they’re born .Even if they do survive, pets might age faster or have a higher risk of obtain ing diseases. The fact that the c hromosomes taken from th e donor , shorter than normal , might give clones a shorter life span. Donors could have defects in their organs, which co uld pass on to cloned animals. Dolly, for example, died at six, which was half the lifespan of an average sheep. The mice cloned from somatic cells died early , and their lifespan was reported to be shorter than the genotype, presenting the possibility of the such technology’s long -term detrimental effects (Ogonuki, 2002). However, Bu rgstaller ’s (2017) research provides an opposing view. O ther sheep that were cloned with the same cell line as Dolly lived close to their natural lifespan. The maximum lifespan of most animals cloned (such as mice, sheep, cats, and dogs) has been proven to reach their natural lifespans, although the cloned lifespan of oth er species has yet to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim reported that the health Snuppy , the first cloned dog, was monitored throughout its life. Notably, both Snuppy and the dog that provided the genetic mat erial (cell donor) developed cancer at similar ages. Reclones of Snuppy are not expected to age in an accelerated speed nor would the y exhibit a greater tendency of develop ing diseases than naturally bred animals (Kim, 2017). The reason of why Dolly lived shorter while Snuppy didn’t is unanswered. The health and longevity of cloned animals are still uncertain and additional research could be made to refine the answer to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scnt---reprogramming-and-a-dvancements&#34;&gt;SCNT - Reprogramming and A dvancements
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades -old, the SCNT process was widely used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning and has been applied to the cloning of a variety of animals, such as pigs, goats, cats, and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the success rate is very low, 3.4% -13% for each embryo transferre d, and even lower, 0.3% -1.7% for a reconstructed oocyte (Burgstaller, 2017). The efficiency varies bet ween 0.1% - 16% (Srirattana, 2022), though recent technology is said to have improved the efficiency, and further refinements would be made to SCNT to make better use of it (Matoba, 2018). Numerous approaches to increase efficiency have been utilized in oocytes, cloned embryos, and cell d onors (Srirattana , 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still barriers to the reprogramming of genes, such as genome instability and incomplete reprogramming , with the latter causing problems abnormalities such as large birth weight, unusual organ size, respiratory problems, and weakened immune systems (Gouveia, 2020). It should be noted though, that different species could exhibit different problems. Bovine clones could become obese, while pig clones would be concerned with underweight and underdeveloped placenta problems, an d murine clones would be i nvolved with abnormal placentas (Gouveia, 2020) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somatic cell nuclear transfer has potential, but there are still problems to overcome such as low efficiency, and reprogramming difficulties leading to abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though numerous people are willing to resurrect their pets using cloning, there could be potential drawbacks. The efficiency and the health of the clones are still debatable, which would vary depending on different species, different donors, and different techniques used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Somatic Cell Nuclear T ransfer technology is still developing, and is beneficial in ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as cloning animals to keep their highly valued traits, increasing numbers of endangered species, or creating transgenic animals for medical u se (Sumer, 2009), it is questionable whether pet cloning is worth it. Dr. Robert Klitzman (2018) , Columbia University ’s academic director of the master of sci ence in bioethics program speaks out his concerns that the use of pet cloning isn’t beneficial to the health of people or pets, and claims that such operations should only be implemented if it increases the advancement of medical and scientific research. While some people see pet cloning as a way to cope with the loss of a beloved pet, it should raise concerns about its little scientific value, ethical implications and accessibility only to those with significant financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
