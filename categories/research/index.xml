        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;摘要&#34;&gt;摘要
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;本文基于结构主义与黑格尔辩证法的理论，分析了电影《瞬息全宇宙》中伊芙琳与女儿乔伊关系的变化，旨在回答“女主角和女儿的关系为何突然发生巨大转变”这一问题。我们的研究表明母女冲突的根源在于象征秩序对真实界符号化的必然失败。具体而言，面对秩序崩溃，伊芙琳的初期应对策略是借助“幻想”并通过“增强能指在能指链上滑动”来压制剩余。但符号化的过程必然生产新的剩余，过度的符号化最终会导致“主体死亡”。伊芙琳的转变在于：她放弃了对“剩余”（失控的女儿乔伊）的暴力镇压企图，直接面对这个“剩余”，进而转向了“容纳”与“共生”。从历时性的角度而言，这真正的本质是辩证法所提供的运动性：正题与反题的矛盾冲突，最终必然运动出了一个能容纳矛盾的合题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关键词：剩余，象征秩序，结构主义，辩证法，《瞬息全宇宙》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;引言&#34;&gt;引言
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;电影《瞬息全宇宙》开篇呈现了华裔移民伊芙琳及其家庭在美国面临的重重生存压力。伊芙琳经营着一家濒临倒闭的洗衣店，她时常陷入税务纠纷和家庭关系的困境。她的现实生活正经历着多重结构性崩溃：洗衣店经营濒临破产边缘；女儿Joy的成长轨迹与她的设想严重偏离，丈夫韦蒙不仅表现怯懦，更在此时意图提出离婚；她的父亲对伊芙琳施加着无形的控制。在此情景下，伊芙琳与家庭成员的关系普遍紧张，尤其与女儿Joy之间的冲突尤为尖锐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一场景中，伊芙琳与她的父亲和韦蒙一起去税务局查账。进入电梯的后，韦蒙突然摘下眼镜，性格瞬间转变。他变成了与现实相反，果敢，强势，控制欲强的韦蒙，以命令式口吻和伊芙琳说“别多问！”和“我来！”。
韦蒙告诉伊芙琳，他们最大的敌人是多重宇宙中的“大魔王”乔布·图帕基，一个拥有无穷的力量和知识，是全能的存在，与现实中无能，被视为“失败者”的女儿相反。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;转变到第二场景后，伊芙琳在韦蒙的带领下不断变强，在不同的宇宙中穿梭，习得越来越多的技能来打败不同的敌人。然而，随着伊芙琳能力的增强，她发现她的女儿也随之变得更强，她始终无法战胜。无论她穿越到哪一个宇宙，她的女儿都会跟过来追杀她。在其中一个宇宙中，Joy向伊芙琳揭示了她最终的目的——她渴望母亲能与她看到“相同之物”，也就是凝聚了她所有能看到的东西的贝果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在第三场景，在她与乔布·图帕基战斗时，她的身体不堪重负，呕吐后突然倒下死亡了。接着画面便开始切换，伊芙琳在多重宇宙中迅速切换。在成为大明星的伊芙琳的宇宙中，韦蒙向伊芙琳阐述了自己的生存之道，也就是“be kind”。这给伊芙琳提供了一种新的对抗方和相处方式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在后续的对抗中，她不再渴望武力压制，而是让步、满足对方的需求。例如，面对一位渴望治愈脊椎损伤的保安，伊芙琳在交锋过程中为其正骨，消除了他的痛苦并为其带来满足感，从而化解了他的攻击欲望。伊芙琳也减少了对女儿的控制欲。这一点集中体现在她们都化身为石头的宇宙中：她安静地聆听女儿的心声，充分尊重女儿乔伊的想法。当女儿跳下悬崖时，她并未阻拦，而是尊重其选择，并随她一同跃下。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳学会了包容与让步之后，回到现实中，对自己的女儿袒露了心声，同时也真的开始倾听自己女儿说的话。她对自己的女儿表示理解，但也有约法三章。后来在这个家庭中，伊芙琳对家人表达了更多的理解，进而修复了家庭关系。最终税务困境也得到了解决。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;问题提出&#34;&gt;问题提出
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;基于以上的叙述脉络，本文旨在解答核心问题：“伊芙琳和女儿的关系为什么会突然发生那么大的转变？”我们将该问题分解为3个子问题：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景一中，伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是相反的？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景二中，为什么伊芙琳越强，女儿和贝果也越强？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在场景三中，伊芙琳的心态是如何发生变化的？为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;电影分析&#34;&gt;电影分析
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题1在场景一中伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系&#34;&gt;问题1：在场景一中，伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想&#34;&gt;伊芙琳为什么突然开始幻想？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;在第一场景中，伊芙琳突然见到性格大变的韦蒙，并非偶然，而是她在面对分崩离析的生活时感到崩溃，从而产生的幻想，用幻想来弥补自己的崩溃。她经营的洗衣店濒临破产，与女儿的关系紧张，丈夫也表现得软弱无力，这对伊芙琳来说是一种剩余（surplus）暴露。这一剩余指的是现实（象征界）中无法被符号整合、不被语言命名的部分，它暴露出秩序的不完整和无法掌控之处。于是，伊芙琳用幻想填补了剩余的缺口。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系&#34;&gt;为什么现实与幻想中的角色形象是对比的关系？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;在这个想象界中，韦蒙的原有性格——软弱、胆小，突然变成了“果断”“强势”的新性格，韦蒙就是伊芙琳幻想出来的另一种可能性。这种性格变化显示了幻想的支撑作用：她希望韦蒙成为一个能掌控局势、带她逃离混乱现实的人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;韦蒙所说的“最大敌人”乔布·图帕基，是对现实中Joy的极端想象化处理。现实中，Joy的离经叛道令伊芙琳失望，她无法直接接受女儿的真实状态，于是Joy被转化为一个“全知全能”的形象。这种想象中的乔布·图帕基代表着一个无法被象征系统完全容纳的“剩余”——也就是Joy身上那些超出伊芙琳理解和控制范围的部分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总之，那些突然变化的角色形象由伊芙琳的幻想产生，这种幻想是精神的补丁。用来处理现实中象征秩序功能无法完全整合主体经验后产生的剩余。第一场景中的幻想从结构上揭示了家庭关系中的裂缝，也着重显示了母女关系中的裂缝之大。这同时也是埋下了后续关系修复与缓和的种子。只有真正面对乔布·图帕基，伊芙琳才有可能真正承认、理解那个复杂、离经叛道的女儿Joy。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题2在场景二中为什么伊芙琳越强女儿和贝果也越强&#34;&gt;问题2：在场景二中，为什么伊芙琳越强，女儿和贝果也越强？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;当伊芙琳在不同宇宙穿梭，学习她们的技能时，她的能指也在不断的叠加。当她穿梭到每一个宇宙中，这些能指重叠链接，形成了一条越来越长，不断滑动的能指链。能指链的形成并不能够产生意义，不稳定，而是永远处于滑动之中。她在变强，但‘变强’的方式是通过不断吸收能指，更快地滑动能指链，不断地增强她的象征秩序。这种不停滑动的能指反倒揭示了她无法在象征秩序中派指出自己的稳定位置，她只不过是将无数个能指拼接在一起，试图用此方法来防止自己面对真实界。但每当她跳到新的宇宙中（更换能指），她并不能完全符号化真实界，但却产生了新的剩余。所以，每一次的转变能指都会产生新的剩余。而她女儿的贝果就恰好代表了剩余，指向的是真实界，无法言说之物。伊芙琳每一次的攻击建立在象征界上，是希望通过增强象征秩序而去制约剩余，但剩余无法被囊括在象征界内，它在结构上无法被表达。贝果和女儿处在的这种结构性的位置上否定了伊芙琳依赖能指增强自己的实力的方式，使伊芙琳无法战胜她的女儿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;问题3在场景三中为什么伊芙琳死亡了为什么被打败后才寻求改变伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化如何发生的&#34;&gt;问题3：在场景三中，为什么伊芙琳死亡了？为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化？如何发生的？
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么伊芙琳死亡了&#34;&gt;为什么伊芙琳死亡了？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;随着伊芙琳在多重宇宙中不断用暴力的方式击败（镇压）对手（是秩序化的体现），当她进入场景三直面女儿乔伊（乔布·图帕基）（也就是剩余本身）时，突然呕吐并随即倒地“死亡”。这里的“呕吐”正是身体对“真实界”的入侵——即主体被迫直接遭遇那创伤性的、无法被符号化的“剩余”（the leftover）——所做出的最直接、最原始的反应。 伊芙琳此前通过不断学习并叠加多重宇宙的技能，本质上是持续加强原先的“能指”（signifiers），试图以此增加伊芙琳的控制能力，即增强象征界应对和管理混乱表象的能力。然而，这种能指增加恰恰意味着“符号化过程”（symbolization）的不断加强，也即象征界疆域的不断膨胀。 伊芙琳的“死亡”，其核心原因在于：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;主体结构最终无法承受过度的能指，最终发生了崩溃。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;每一次符号化行为（获取新技能），虽然在象征界内部看似增强了秩序，但都必然产生无法被消化的创伤性“剩余”。伊芙琳每一次通过符号化来压制混乱，实则是在持续积累这些产生出来的剩余。当她最终直面女儿（即剩余本身的化身）时，这些被压抑的剩余最终以最猛烈的方式进行了反扑。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;正如拉康所言，“象征符正是对事物的谋杀”（“The symbol manifests itself first of all as the murder of the thing”） （埃文斯，1996，p.61）。象征界作为符号化秩序，其运作本身就意味着对主体的动态性的抹杀。伊芙琳试图通过无限扩大象征界（获取更多能指）来解决问题（也就是不断增强自己的主导能指，恰恰使其主体深陷于符号秩序的牢笼之中，丧失了动态性，最终导致了主体性“死亡”——这正是过度象征化的必然恶果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;为什么被打败后才寻求改变&#34;&gt;为什么被打败后，才寻求改变？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;当在场景三的“死亡”后，伊芙琳开始采取新的与人相处的方式，也就是从强势的控制，让步给对方留出了更多的空间。在“死亡”之前，伊芙琳的策略始终是通过不断强化既有能指的强度（也就是不断学习多重宇宙中的各种技能），试图增强自己的控制力来 “管理”混乱。然而，最后的“死亡”作为了一个转折点。 正是这里的“死亡”，伊芙琳才真正开始承认了自己的主体是有裂缝的主体，直接面对了自己的创伤——她对女儿，对生意的无能为力。唯有在直接面对剩余之后，她才需要使用新的能指（signifiers）（如“留出空间”），以此尝试重构其崩解的主体性，并重新建立合适的秩序。这一重构目的，是试图（暂时地）延宕（defer）真实界剩余的反扑，稳定主体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化如何发生变化的&#34;&gt;伊芙琳的心态发生了什么样的变化？如何发生变化的？
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳的心态及其和他人的互动模式发生了根本性蜕变：她摒弃了依赖武力压制（一种暴力的秩序化）的旧有方式，转而采用以退让满足对方需求的新方式；对待女儿也从强制性的控制转向了倾听与陪伴。这一深刻的心态转变，核心原因在于她承认了自己的主体是有裂缝的主体、直面了创伤，认识了剩余。她旧的能指系统（以暴力控制为核心）已经不够用了，由此她主动开始寻求改变。伊芙琳从她丈夫那吸收了“Be Kind（以善意方式对待他人）”这个能指，使自己的能指库发生了变化。然而，伊芙琳并没有简单的直接接受能指：她将丈夫的“善意”（Kindness）能指与自身的旧能指（暴力镇压）进行了重组，最终构建出一个全新的能指。这一新能指比旧能指更柔和（体现“善意”的接纳与非暴力），但依然保留了控制的意图——其控制方式从显性的暴力镇压转化为对方接受或喜欢的更加隐性的控制方式，形成了一种“以善意为名的引导”。电影中也对此提供了有力佐证：在“正骨”情节中，表面是满足需求的服务行为（体现善意），实则暗含对身体的强力矫正与掌控（保留的控制性），展现了 “以服务之名行控制之实”的本质；而在“石头宇宙”场景中，超越语言的静默陪伴，恰恰成为有效阻止女儿坠入虚无（实现终极控制目标） 的最有力手段。因此，伊芙琳的心态变化，本质上是在符号性死亡的废墟上，通过融合新旧能指（“善意”与“控制”），形成了全新的更为温和的（承认剩余的）能指，让家庭变得更和谐，也让整个家庭的能指链重新开始滑动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;结论&#34;&gt;结论
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;汇总&#34;&gt;汇总
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;母女关系的巨大转变，并非源于伊芙琳在力量上“战胜”了女儿，而是源于她经历了象征秩序的崩溃（死亡）后，放弃了对“剩余”（女儿）的暴力镇压企图，转向了“容纳”与“共生”。她不再试图消除女儿的不可控性和虚无感（贝果），而是学会了在承认并接纳这些“剩余”的前提下，运用融合了善意与引导的新策略（温和霸权）来重建连接与秩序。这种转变的核心是：从“消除裂缝”到“与裂缝共存”，从“控制”到“陪伴与倾听”。这最终修复了现实中的母女关系，并化解了其他现实困境（如税务问题），象征着新的、更具包容性的主体性和家庭秩序的重建。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;讨论&#34;&gt;讨论
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;齐泽克认为黑格尔的想法是：“辩证法远非有关逐步克服（progressive overcoming）的故事，而是对如此努力之失败所作的系统注释—“绝对知识”（absolute knowledge）指的是这样一种主体立场，它最终接受了“矛盾”，并把矛盾视为每个同一性（every identity）的内在条件。” 根据黑格尔所述，绝对知识是一种对于认知结构本身就存在悖论的认识和接受，是自我和现实中达成调和的认知状态。但这种状态不是固定的，而是运动的。本文同时讨论到了黑格尔的辩证法，并将此的应用将限于正题，反题和合题。正题(Thesis)，及发展的起点，是某种观点，存在或状态。反题(Antithesis)，即对立面的显现，是对于正题的否定。合题(Synthesis)，即对立面的统一，包含了正题与反题，并将其中的矛盾克服。任何命题都是有漏洞的，有对立面（及反题）。正题和反题是主体和剩余之间的关系，被主体连在一起，无法拆开（运动性）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如，一个人“希望自己能变得更好，希望能更自律” （正题）；但他在“成为更好的自己”的过程中常常受到想刷视频，放空，聊天的困扰，这使他开始想‘我正在做的这些事情无法使我变得更好’ （反题）,否定了他对自己‘变得更好’的定义。他感受到两者之间的冲突后，有一天终于承认 ”我对变好的渴望和对想刷视频，想放空休息的渴望同时存在。“在面对两者之间的冲突中，他并不再希望判断或克服对错，而是接受了二者之间的矛盾，认识到了正是这种矛盾构成了他自己。但这在不断运动——他对“更好”的定义可能在不断的改变，在休息与努力中来回摇摆。他后续意识到这种问题，并且认识到‘我’在‘变好’的冲动中也存在着失败和偷懒，但‘我’仍然在冲突中前行。他在二者的矛盾之间前行，在知道自己会摇摆的前提下偶尔会选择去刷视频，偶尔会愿意早起背单词。合题并不是在正题与反题中找到中间值，而是在冲突与矛盾中演变，上升与创新。但这在不断运动——他对“更好”的定义可能在不断的改变，在休息与努力中来回摇摆。他在二者的矛盾之间前行，在知道自己会摇摆的前提下偶尔会选择去刷视频，偶尔会愿意早起背单词。他的这种行为形成了新的合题；在认识到并接受不断运动的矛盾，也便是黑格尔所说的绝对知识。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;伊芙琳最开始在面对她崩溃的象征界的方式是通过不断的滑动能指，不接受真实界中暴露出来的剩余（正题），而她的女儿（反题）代表着剩余，属于真实界的。当伊芙琳经历过死亡后并且吸收了她老公的能指，她开始面对剩余，而且不再执着于通过符号化去面对真实界。她认识并接受了正题与反题之间的冲突，向绝对知识靠拢。对于绝对知识的把握利于她更好地运动，形成合题。她后续选择了使用她的方法，在跟女儿吵架后学会了让步，但同时也表达出了她自己的诉求，在面对正题和反题中开辟出了新的道路（合题）。伊芙琳在与女儿斗争时就是正题与反题的运动和发展，在过程中不停的尝试，自然生出了新的合题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;研究启示&#34;&gt;研究启示
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;对于《瞬息全宇宙》的分析，也为我们理解现实生活中的母女关系与个体自我发展提供了深刻的启示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在家庭关系中，子女的选择偶尔会与家长所规划的道路冲突。如果父母强行左右子女的兴趣想法（即进行“符号化”），而非直接面对双方存在的差异，矛盾和冲突只会加剧，导致更严重的负面后果。父母应该认识到彼此之间选择的差异，并与子女共同面对。但这里并不意味着父母需要完全接纳子女的想法，也不意味着子女要必须服从父母的想法，而是认识到双方想法间的冲突。比如当母亲对女儿选择专业的道路感到不满时，母亲应该意识到女儿对自己专业的抉择与自己期望女儿选择的专业是冲突的。随着双方在逐渐深入地认识彼此的想法后，解决二者之间的冲突的方式就可以不是任意一方去迁就另一方，而是可以在冲突之间开辟出新的道路，达成一种动态平衡。比如母亲可以尝试了解女儿所选专业的价值与发展前景，女儿也可以倾听母亲的担忧与经验；双方通过深入沟通可能会发现，可以在主修专业之外辅修相关课程，或者寻找两个领域的交叉方向，在尊重彼此立场的基础上找到更具创新性的解决方案。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人与人的关系并非追求无冲突的乌托邦，而是在于建立将冲突转化为成长动力的机制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;注释&#34;&gt;注释
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;能指（英：signifier；法：signifiant）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉康将一个“能指”（英：signifier；法：signifiant）定义为“为另一能指代表一个主体的东西”。例如“爱”这个字或其发音“ai”是一个“能指”，当我们说出“我爱你”这句话时，我们就使用了这个能指，它试图去指向某种情感或关系状态，也就是我们通常称之为“爱”的“所指”（英：signified；法：signifié）。然而，这个所指并非一个固定、明确的情感实体本身。相反，它在一个能指链中滑动。如，“爱”可能与“欲望”、“忠诚”、“痛苦”、“缺失”等能指相关联，其具体意义依赖于语境和其他能指。能指是凭借自己与该系统内其他能指之间的差异来呈现其自身价值的，也就是说能指a之所以时是能指a，是因为能指a不是能指b也不是能指c。所以能指永远都无法具有某种单一或固定的意义。比如说，对于厌学的学生来说，自由就是不上学。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;所指（英：signified；法：signifié）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉康认为“所指”是“能指”的一种效果，是经由隐喻而产生的意指过程的一种效果。也就是说“所指”不是给定的，而是生成的。比如说，“狗”这个词或者发音是一个“能指”。当我们听到“狗”这个词时，它并不直接、固定地指向某个单一的、明确的“狗的概念”。不同的人、不同的语境下，这个词引发的想法、情感、联想（即所指）是完全不同的。在情景A中：有人会说：“看，有一只可爱的狗。” 这里的所指（也就是具体的动物）是在“狗”与“猫”、“鸟”等其他动物能指的差异中相对确立的，不同人想到的具体狗的形象也不同（例如，金毛 贵宾犬）。在情景B中， 有人说：“他真是个忠实的朋友，像条狗一样。” 这里，“狗”这个“能指”隐喻性地替代了“极度忠诚”这个“能指”。所指效果变成了“绝对的忠诚”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;能指链（英：Signifying chain 法：chaîne signifiante）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;能指链条指的就是相互关联的能指构成的序列，是永无止尽的。当一个人说：“我梦到森林&amp;hellip;” 时，森林是第一个能指。它本身有很多含义，但具体指向什么还不明确。当他后面他接着说：“&amp;hellip;那森林很黑暗&amp;hellip;”，“黑暗” 是第二个能指，链接到了第一个能指，限定“森林”的性质。随后，他又说，”我感到特别的孤独…”，“孤独” 是第三个能指，进一步指定了他在黑暗森林中的感受。现在，“森林-黑暗-孤独”形成了一个能指链条。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;剩余（英：surplus 法：plus）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;指符号化（用语言表达）过程中不可避免产生的超出部分，是一种溢出，它总在意义之外、抵抗被完全表达；同时也是象征秩序中固有的结构性裂隙，属于真实界的部分。
它就好比整理行李箱时放进太多衣物，我们试图强行拉上拉链，但是始终有一部分会卡住拉链，让拉链无法被完全拉上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;象征界（英：Symbolic，法：symbolique）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;象征界（英：Symbolic，法：symbolique）是结构化的。是语言、法律、社会规范、文化的领域，是“名字之父”统治下的秩序系统，本质上是一个语言的维度。象征界是一说话就被迫加入的、管理着我们生活方方面面的社会规则系统，加入它让我们成为社会人，但也让我们戴上了“语言”和“规则”的面具，无法再完全“做自己”（直接表达原始欲望）。比如说，象征界就像是一个巨大的、无形的“规则网”或“游戏规则手册”。 这个“规则网”不是物理存在的，但它像空气一样无处不在，深刻地影响着我们如何生活、如何理解自己和世界。用更具体的例子来说：刚出生的婴儿饿了，会直接哇哇大哭；看到妈妈，会咿咿呀呀伸手要抱。这是最直接的欲望表达，这时还没有进入语言。接着，他妈妈开始教他：“这是‘妈妈’”，“这是‘奶瓶’”，“‘饿’了要说‘饿’”。宝宝学会了用“妈妈”这个符号代表那个特定的人，用“饿”这个词代表肚子不舒服的感觉，用“奶瓶”代表那个能解除饥饿的物体。 这时就进入了象征界，他不再只是用哭喊这种原始方式表达饥饿，必须通过“饿”这个词来代表他的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;想象界（英：Imaginary，法：imaginaire）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想象界（英：Imaginary，法：imaginaire）是幻象、形象与空想、欺骗与诱骗的领域。是整体性、综合性、自主性。是具有欺骗性，有可观察的现象的领域。想象界就类似于照哈哈镜。镜子里那个被拉长、压扁或扭曲的形象，就是幻象。当我们凝视镜中那个看似完整统一的人形，瞬间会产生一种“那就是我”的强烈认同感——这就是想象界的欺骗性与诱骗性。它用一个外在的、虚幻的视觉形象，诱使我们误认为 这个扭曲的、看似自主可控的镜像就是我们真实、完整的自己。当象征界无法完全符号化实在界的时候，想象界就会出现暂时弥补。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;实在界（英：real, 法：réel）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实在界（英：real, 法：réel）指的是不可言说，无法被象征的事物。他独立于人类建构的符号，是永远无法被象征化的剩余部分。当言语无法解释某物，真实界就会显露来，以焦虑、创伤或荒谬的形式出现。实在界就好比小时候听到父母吵架时候的冲击，那是一种无法用语言表达出来的冲击，改变了他原本对家庭结构的看法。这种东西无法被整合入象征界，小孩子的已有认知，而是存在于象征之外，无法被覆盖或描述。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;死亡（英：death；法：mort）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是象征秩序的构成性要素，象征符（symbol）代替了它所象征的事物，从而便等同于那一事物的死亡，正如同拉康所述，“象征符是对于事物的谋杀”。比如，当一个人被取名“张三”后，每次叫“张三”，是在叫这个符号而不是这个人，这个人就被“张三”这个符号代替了，动态的，变化的一个人就被符号固定住了，被叫“张三”的这个人就受到了象征符的谋杀。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;能指宝库（英：battery of signifiers 法：)：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;能指宝库是在象征秩序中已经存在的能指集合。它是象征系统中语言，文化，社会规范等的储备库。能指宝库具有权威性，因为主体必须通过能指宝库中的能指指派自己的身份；它还具有匮乏性，因为能指宝库中的所有能指无法完全符号化真实界。能指宝库好比与于给婴儿取名时的命名系统，涵盖着里面的姓氏，汉字，和文化规则等；但这个名字永远无法彻底代表主体本身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;焦虑（英：anxiety 法： angoisse）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是一种我们无法定位无法摆脱的强烈不安感。它不是对某个具体丧失某个东西的反应，而是在我们无法确认失去的是什么，甚至不确定是否真的失去了什么时产生的不适。它可能发生在某个熟悉的事物突然变得陌生、熟悉的关系突然中断、或者我们不知道自己在别人眼中意味着什么的时候。就像一个人在不透明的奶茶杯里吸不到东西，不知道原因为何。只是，他无法用奶茶喝完了，或者吸管坏了来解释。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;滑动（英：slip 法：glisser【动词】，glissement【名词】）：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拉康使用动词“滑动”(slip)(及其相应的名词“滑移”[slippage])来描述能指与所指之间的不稳定关系。例如，“狗”这个词，就是一个能指，它就像一个飘在水面上的标签。你第一次学它时，它可能稳稳贴在你家金毛犬身上。但很快你发现，邻居的哈士奇、小巧的吉娃娃也叫“狗”；甚至有人形容独身的朋友为“单身狗”，抱怨“累成狗”，或者骂人时说“狗东西”。这时你会发现，“狗”这个标签根本无法固定在一个单个的东西上——它在不同的场合滑动着、漂移着，指向宠物、品种、比喻人、比喻状态甚至辱骂。词语（能指）和它想表达的具体意思（所指）之间，并没有天生锁死的链条，而是在语境中不断滑动。&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the ancient tragedies of Greece to the modern-day downfalls of business tycoons and political leaders, the concept of hubris has served as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked power. The theme hubris was already apparent in Greek tragedies, where it mostly meant disrespecting the gods by not crediting ones’ success or fortune to the gods (Marquez, 2015), often leading to nemesis (divine retribution) and ate (ruin). The meaning of hubris has then evolved into excessive arrogance and over-confidence that leads to self-destruction (Marquez, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen coined the term hubris syndrome to describe how power can distort judgement and behavior, mostly evident in political leaders (2008). As it isn’t a diagnostic category of mental illness, Selten points out that the term still needs further validation since it’s not included in classification systems (2023), but the phenomena it describes is timeless. This syndrome can be observed in literary characters such as Agamemnon and Gatsby. Though written centuries apart, both portray characters whose personality traits lead to their tragic endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon, the first play in the Oresteia trilogy performed in 458 BCE, is one of the greatest works of classical Greek tragedy and explores the tragic downfall of Agamemnon and the revenge of Clytemnestra. Set after the Trojan war, King Agamemnon comes back home to Argos, victorious. Clytemnestra, Agamemnon’s wife, waits for him. She knows that Agamemnon has sacrificed his daughter for favorable winds in order to claim glory that rivals the gods, and harboring deep resentment, plots to kill him in order for revenge. Upon his arrival, Agamemnon further demonstrates his hubris by treading upon a sacred purple carpet, a gesture reserved for the gods, thereby further transgressing the boundaries between mortal and divine. As Cassandra, the prophet, warns him of his tragic fate, Agamemnon ignores her omens. Such disregard sets the stage for his doom as Agamemnon gets killed ultimately by Clytemnestra. His ego makes him believe that he can defy fate and his divine punishment, blinding him from reality and leading him towards death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in 1925, the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby shows a character whose hubris ultimately leads to his downfall. However, while Agamemnon’s defies fate, Gatsby clings to an unattainable dream: the revival of his relationship with Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the narrator, meets Jay Gatsby, his neighbor, a wealthy man living in the West Egg who throws a party in his mansion every Sunday night, hoping to meet Daisy Buchanan once to rekindle their love. He ignores Daisy’s marriage with Tom Buchanan. Although, Daisy ultimately chooses Tom, Gatsby refuses to acknowledge the impossibility of his dream. His willingness to take the blame for Daisy as accidentally kills Myrtle with Gatsby’s car further illustrates his intense attitude towards chasing his dream. Jay Gatsby shows hubris in his relentless pursuit of an unattainable dream with Daisy, and his unyielding belief in his power, his ability, his wealth and status. Gatsby’s tragic ending underscores the consequences of hubris, and suggests that the American Dream, the green light he longs for, is an illusion only achieved by the privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;literature-review&#34;&gt;Literature review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hubris syndrome, or Hubristic syndrome, is broadly investigated as a personality trait disorder. Scholars increasingly contend that hubris significantly influences many decisions by those in power. Diamandis (2018) suggests it is power which leads to such behaviors, manifesting as overconfidence, lack of self-control, and morally wrong actions. Owen agrees, claiming that the hubristic syndrome usually occurs when people hold power for a long time, making them develop an inflated view of their abilities. Owen identifies 13 symptoms characterizing this syndrome, and claims that individuals with a portrayal of over 3- 4 symptoms acquire such syndrome. For the purpose of this research, symptoms are categorized into three principal categories: vanity, overconfidence, and solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanity is an inflated sense of self (Merriam-Webster, 2025). People with such traits tend to base their actions on public perceptions, making decisions based in accordance of how others want to perceive them. Symptom 2 (a preference for taking actions in order to improve their reputation), and 3 (an unreasonable concern with image) directly reflects their occupation with image. Symptoms 1 (viewing the world as a place primarily as an area to seek power and glory), 5 (identifies their motives and outlook identical with the one of the nation) and 6 (tends to talk in third person) demonstrate the desire to create an image of supremacy (Owen, 2008). Excessive confidence is defined as being too confidence in one’s ability or decisions (Merriam-Webster, 2025). This trait involves arrogance, and an inflated sense of one’s judgements and ability, believing one has higher status than others. These symptoms are in accordance with symptom 7 (has excessive confidence of their judgement and disrespects the advice of others), 8 (believes one has supremacy in what they can achieve), and 9 (thinks they’re accountable to a higher power such as god than the public opinion) (Owen, 2008). Overconfidence would lead one to ignore their incompetence (Myers, 2019 ), leading to reckless behavior and ignorance in some problems. This is similar to that of symptoms 10 (exhibits reckless, impulsive and restless behavior),12 (tends to have a ‘broad vision’, making them ignore practical details, costs, and potential negative consequences), and 13(makes these mistakes not due to fault analysis, but due to lack of attention caused by overconfidence) (Owen, 2008). Solitude means the state of being alone from a society (Merriam-Webster, 2025). In this context, it means the isolation of oneself, often becoming detached from reality (symptom 11: loses contact with reality, becoming progressively isolated). People who have a fervent attitude on what they do, shown in symptom 4 (has a fervent attitude on the things they do and tend to have exaltation in manner), tend to further isolate them from society (Owen, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This categorization allows for a systematic analysis of hubristic traits in literary characters, examining how such traits contribute to their eventual downfall. The framework is based on the assumption that prolonged exposure to power fundamentally alters judgment, increasing susceptibility to irrational behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical literature has long examined the theme hubris, with ancient Greek tragedies portraying it as a fatal flaw that leads to severe consequences. Icarus falling to death as the flew too close to the sun (Ovid, 8 CE) demonstrates overconfidence, as he ignores Daedalus’ warnings and tries to defy human limitations. Hubris was also apparent in other works, as Doko described multiple characters such as Beowulf, King Lear, and Gatsby with such characteristics (2021). He claimed that the errors they made, for example, King Lear’s pride blocked him from distinguishing lies and the truth, becomes the reason for their tragic ends. Hidayati explored hubris syndrome in Moby Dick, arguing that Ahab’s reckless pursuit of the whale leads him to the isolation of his crew, leading to their deaths (2021). This confirms Owen’s proposition that Hubris syndrome causes irrational behaviour, leading to his tragic end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gap-and-research-question&#34;&gt;Gap and Research question
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen uses political figures in history such as George W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair to show that the hubris syndrome is applicable in real life (Owen, 2008), while Selten (2023) highlights Napoleon Bonaparte and Mao Zedong as further examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, Owen’s work bridges the gap between psychological analysis and historical documentation, helping people understand how the hubris is manifested in real-life contexts. However, his emphasis on political leaders leaves room to explore hubris beyond political history, particularly in literary narratives. Hidayati, Arifuddin (2021) has already inspected its exhibition in only one book- Moby Dick, where the captain of a whale hunting vessel, Ahab portrays hubris syndrome as he constantly seeks down the white sperm whale named Moby Dick. Literature works offer insights in the potential consequences of human behavior, serving as cautionary reflections that deepen our understanding for real life. However, this article remains isolated as other literature articles analyze the theme hubris but not the syndrome. Little research systematically analyzes hubristic traits across multiple literature works in different eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that while hubristic syndrome was not formally defined until the late 20th century, its expressions are clearly evident in historical and literary figures across different eras. Choosing two literature pieces from different eras, this study will examine the presence and impact of hubristic syndrome in two distinct literary figures: Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. This  analysis will explore the specific traits associated with hubristic syndrome, trying to diagnosis the characters of this syndrome and discover how it ultimately contribute to their tragic fates. This study aims to contribute to a broader understanding of how the hubris syndrome manifests across time periods and cultural context, offering a novel application for Owen’s work. Therefore, this research seeks to answer the following question: 1) How do the characteristics of Agamemnon in Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and Jay Gatsby in F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby manifest the hubristic syndrome as defined by Owen? 2) To what extent does their downfall illustrate the consequences of this syndrome? While not trying to validate the syndrome clinically, the study tries to provide literary validation and applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this premise, the study hypothesizes that hubristic syndrome was portrayed throughout the two pieces of literature, and served as a key factor in the downfall of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study employs a qualitative content analysis methodology (Miles and Huberman, 1994 ; Krippendorff, 2018) to investigate how hubris is depicted in literature. The primary data sources are Aeschylus&amp;rsquo;s Agamemnon and F. Scott Fitzgerald&amp;rsquo;s The Great Gatsby. These works were selected for their thematic relevance to hubris and their influence on their respective literary traditions. The analysis seeks to identify symptoms that reflect hubristic syndrome, following Owen’s (2008) framework. Given the scope and timeframe of the study, only two pieces of literature were selected, and symptoms were extracted from a few chapters with the appearance of such character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is segmented into units including character trait or significant plot events. The study examines how these behaviors and themes are expressed within the narratives and highlights their implications, including the consequences of these hubris-driven actions. To enhance reliability, a quantitative study was employed in looking at the prevalence of each characteristic in the literature pieces. A quantitative frequency count was conducted in looking at the appearance of each trait. The appearance of symptoms in each event was counted and summed up, utilizing a basic spreadsheet software for data organization. An integration of qualitative interpretation with quantitative data allows for a nuanced understanding of the extent to which characters portray hubris syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;44&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Great Gatsby, I looked at the prevalence of each trait in chapter 2-7, where Gatsby appeared. I separated each trait into smaller symptoms, calculating the number of times each trait appeared in each chapter, and added them up to look at the total mentions. The analysis of Gatsby’s portrayal revealed a total of 44 indications of vanity, suggesting a significant emphasis on this trait in his characterization during chapter 2 to chapter 9. The data indicates that Gatsby portrayed the trait vanity most, followed by 17 mentions of excessive confidence and 13 mentions of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Agamemnon, I separated the play into different events according to Agamemnon’s actions or speech. Then I observed what symptoms each event indicated. In total, 6 symptoms were present, suggesting that Agamemnon has the hubris syndrome. With an average of 1.8 identified symptoms of hubris syndrome across the five key events analyzed in Agamemnon (Table 4), the data suggests that manifestations of hubristic traits were not isolated occurrences but rather a consistent element within the play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-vanity&#34;&gt;1. Vanity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanity is a symptom of hubris syndrome, manifesting as a deep, constant obsession with how others perceive the individual. This fixation increases the importance of one’s public persona, which becomes central to their identity. Such individuals view their image as paramount, believing that it must be perfect or associated with high power and wealth in order to achieve superiority. This behavior leads to constant efforts in consolidating their social position, control how others see them, and any perceived threat to this image—such as criticism or failure—may provoke defensive or aggressive reactions. Not only so, individuals start to put emphasis on the voices of others, highly aware of how others would perceive them, thoroughly thinking on how to act to maintain such image (Webster, 2014). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portrayed a great extent of concern with image, Agamemnon as maintaining his image as loyal and obedient to the gods, and Gatsby as maintaining his fake image as the wealthy and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the war, Agamemnon is greeted by Clytemnestra who urges him to step onto the crimson carpets, only greeted by the feet of the gods to step upon (Britannica, 2024). His hesitation upon the offer reveals his anxiety over appearing arrogant in front of the gods and his citizens. He states that only such commodities could only be used on god, politely declining Clytemnestra’s offer. He also refuses with ‘the people murmur, and their voice is great in strength’ (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.938), concerned that his disobedience towards the gods would wreck his image among citizens. Ultimately, he gives in, rationalizing his behavior through Clytemnestra’s suggestion. This uncertainty contrasts sharply with his prior decisiveness during the sacrifice of his daughter, showing an unreasonable concern with image. During the sacrifice, he defiantly issued commands without hesitation and acknowledgment of other people’s thoughts, claiming - “May it be well” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE. l.217). This suggests an inconsistent evaluation of his public image relative to political ambition, making his concerns unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in The Great Gatsby, Gatsby exhibits a relentless commitment in constructing his image of wealth and status. Although originating from a humble origin, he is concerned with his fake image of immense wealth and status to fit into the world of the elite. As he tells Nick, the narrator, of his background, “His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west- all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.70), he puts emphasize on his family wealth and education but the vagueness suggests an intentional fabrication, intended to help him fit into high society. Moreover, he repeatedly emphasizes his image, including his financial status. When Nick questioned his wealth “I thought you inherited your money?” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96), he responds automatically with the narrative below: “I did, old sport” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic- the panic of the war” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.96). He instinctively tries to maintain his titled image. Although his response suits the tone of the upperclassmen, it highlights the fragility of his persona. If he inherited his money, he never should’ve needed 3 years to earn it. The contradictions indicate that Gatsby is concerned with image as his entire existence is built around it, making any disruption of his image vulnerable to his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-excessive-confidence&#34;&gt;2. Excessive Confidence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive confidence leads to poor decision making as it tends to cause individuals to overestimate their abilities or underestimate the challenges they’re facing. Overconfidence is sometimes beneficial as it boosts morale, ambition and increases one’s competition and survival (Johnson &amp;amp; Fowler, 2011). However, excessive confidence can lead to blindness and may impair self-reflection, making failure a persistent outcome in one’s journey (Hidayati et.al. 2021). Fast asserts that when people experience power, they tend to make overconfident decisions that lead to negative outcomes, or ultimately, personal downfall (2011). Overconfidence can be manifested in three different aspects, 1) in the overplacement of believing one to have superior performance than others, 2) in overpercision regarding the accuracy of one’s judgements, 3) in overestimating one’s performance abilities (Moore &amp;amp; Healy, 2007). Both Agamemnon and Gatsby portray this trait, exhibiting unwavering faith in their goals, leading to negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also shows overconfidence in his decision to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia. Although Agamemnon experiences internal struggle regarding the sacrifice, he ultimately does so. However, he fails to see the consequences after sacrificing his daughter to secure victory in the Trojan War. Additionally, this act highlights his authority as he is able to extert control over the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once trapped, she wept, called on her father’s name— as if Iphigeneia’s maidish scream could move his crew of genocidophiles, his entourage of death-squads; or move him.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.228)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He commands soldiers to hold Iphiegnia down, asserting his authority while ignoring her pleas of life. His disregards demonstrate his belief in absolute authority, extending to family members, revealing a detachment from moral responsibility and familial compassion. He is confident to assume that he can compel others to participate in this horrific act without consequence. He overestimates his power regarding the lives of his family, since he sees himself as the one who can determine the fate of those around him, including his daughter. He neglects how Clytemnestra thinks, and thus fails to consider the consequences the act would bring to the whole family. “So with relief he gave it Necessity’s name. Once necked in his yoke, though, we smelt off him something unclean, something desanctified, something set free to defile; new look in his face that said All is permitted for me.” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.218)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon rationalizes his decision by calling it a necessity, convincing himself that it was inevitable. He aligns such matters with the act of the whole nation, claiming it to be for the sake of war. While he frames his decision for the benefit of the nation, the essence of the war was driven my personal motives in retrieving Helen. As he accepts the sacrifice, he no longer seems bound by moral constraints, as if he now believes he can do anything. This could imply his corrupting nature of power and the moral decay that follows his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence also lies in his conviction that his sacrifice is justified for the sake of victory. His desire of victory, that is, to bring Helen back, to demonstrate the powers of the Greek supersedes the lives of those around him, including his own daughter. The morally questionable decision made by him seems to bring harm as he fails to estimate the moral consequences that would bring him. He sees his vision of the future (victory in Troy) as so important that it justifies any action, including extreme violence, like sacrificing Iphigenia. His reckless behaviour (symptom 10) is portrayed through the chorus elder’s words, “So I won’t try to hide from you, my lord, that when you led your army forth—for Helen— you cut a figure I could not applaud. Your plan seemed ill-conceived and uncompelling: to send an army out to die in war to win back what—a voluntary whore?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.800). The elder exposes a deep skepticism toward the rationale for the Trojan expedition, suggesting that Agamemnon’s actions were perceived as impulsive, irrational, and reckless. This critique implies Agamemnon’s reckless acts, pointing to a broader erosion of confidence in Agamemnon’s judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon shows overconfidence through his dismissals of the consequences happening in his palace. He ignores the warnings from Cassandra, the oracle; and he portrays no remorse for his daughter after winning the war. Agamemnon’s greatest threat comes from within his own home. Clytemnestra has spent years plotting his demise, seeking both revenge for Iphigenia and power over Argos. Even when Cassandra warns him of his impending doom, Agamemnon dismisses the danger, assuming that no one in his household would dare challenge him. Upon being struck down, he claims “And now—in my own house—you strike me down?” (Aeschylus, 458 BCE, l.1344). The phrase ‘in my house’ further depicts his  surprise; he perceives his household as an extension of his power, not anticipating any disobedience. Ultimately, Clytemnestra’s act dismantles Agamemnon’s belief and illusion in achieving supremacy and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon’s overconfidence blinds him from suspecting betrayal and leaves him vulnerable, unable to defend himself when the moment of vengeance arrives. In the end, his overconfidence—his certainty that no one, especially not his wife, could defy him—proves to be his undoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Gatsby shows immense confidence in his ability to recreate his relationship with Daisy. He believes that their love has remained unchanged, despite Daisy’s marriage to Tom Buchanan. Gatsby is certain that he could rekindle their love, making him ignore potential limitations. This is portrayed through his words in chapter 6, “‘Repeat the past?’ He cried incredulously, ‘why of course you can!’&amp;hellip; ‘I’m going to fix
everything just the way it was before,’ he said, nodding determinedly, ‘she’ll see.’” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.118).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby’s overconfidence blinds him to Daisy’s divided loyalties. As Nick tells him about Daisy’s attachment with Tom, he refutes with “‘I don’t think she ever loved him.’ Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.137). His refusal to acknowledge Daisy’s past and love life with Tom illustrates his excessive confidence in his judgment and his disregard of the advice of others. His entire faith had been built on the fantasy that Daisy’s love would return to him. However, he was blinded by confidence and failed to account for the gap between reality and fantasy, contributing to his final downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-loneliness&#34;&gt;3. Loneliness
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling occurring in a person when one’s social network is too small or lacks emotional closeness. The feeling arises either when one has few friends or when the intimacy of such relationships hasn’t been fulfilled (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). Prolonged loneliness then progresses into isolation, a social condition rather than a feeling. Isolation occurs when an individual feels alone because they are, in fact, disconnected from others—whether due to the absence of relationships or the failure to establish deep emotional bonds. This state of isolation is particularly harmful because it reinforces feelings of helplessness, inadequacy, and emotional emptiness. As Hunt et al. (2017) highlight, prolonged loneliness and isolation can have detrimental effects on a person&amp;rsquo;s physical and mental health, contributing to a weakened immune system, cardiovascular diseases, suicidal behavior and dementia. Loneliness is influenced by various factors, including the quality and availability of relationships, personality traits, societal norms, and an individual&amp;rsquo;s capacity to adjust to changing circumstances (Jong-Gierveld, 1998). This understanding of loneliness can be applied to The Great Gatsby, as Gatsby’s illusion in the American Dream distances himself from society, while Agamemnon doesn’t exhibit significant signs of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agamemnon, unlike Gatsby, does not distance himself from reality, nor is he stuck in his illusions. He aspires to win the Trojan War, which results in tangible achievements. He does not have a fervent attitude in trying to achieve any goals. It could be pointed out that he is fervent in trying to attain absolute power and supremacy, particularly in his belief of his power over life and death, but it isn’t depicted much in the text. His pursuit of his goals suggests more of a reliance on his status as a king that supports his execution of orders, rather than using a fervent attitude. This contrasts with Gatsby, who centers his character in a passionate pursuit of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby is stuck in his illusions, disassociating himself from reality. He’s stuck in his beliefs, sure that he will attain the American Dream he pursued relentlessly, and that Daisy will come back. The narrator mentioned Gatsby standing at the dock, staring into the distance. He commented, “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.” (Fitzgerald, 1925 p.193). Gatsby is devoted to his dream. He is obsessed, so much that it turns into a symbol of his undying hope, becoming a central part of his identity. He chases it fervently, slowly isolating himself from society. Even with the huge parties he has thrown, he still feels emotionally isolated as nobody truly understands him. This disassociation also appears at the end of the book, where no one comes to his funeral except Nick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of Gatsby’s fervent attitude towards his illusions is when he invites Daisy to afternoon tea. After he asks Daisy to afternoon tea at Nick’s cottage, he looks at the surroundings and ordered for Nick’s grass to be cut. “The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.” (Fitzgerald, 1926, p. 90). While it would be customary to bring a few flowers for such an occasion, Gatsby decides to overwhelm the cottage with an excessive amount of flowers, transforming it into a greenhouse. This reflects his intensity and passion in trying to rekindle his romance with Daisy, aligning with symptom 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.” (Fitzgerald, 1925, p.100). Gatsby here shows Daisy around his mansion, while they were standing at the balcony, looking into the green light. During the moment, Gatsby briefly recognizes that his whole identity was based on pursuing the idealized version of Daisy, which was someone who he could never attain. Even the Daisy right beside him was unattainable due to social and personal barriers between them. Nevertheless, instead of accepting this realization, Gatsby chooses to suppress his doubts and continue chasing his vision with even greater intensity. This denial of reality not only illustrates Gatsby’s deepening obsession but also marks the beginning of his progressive isolation, as he increasingly distances himself from the world as it truly is in favor of his unattainable ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the three main traits of hubris syndrome to interpret the characteristics of the Agamemnon and Gatsby; the results show that Agamemnon and Gatsby both portray Hubris syndrome summed up by three main traits: Vanity, Overconfidence and Loneliness. Gatsby fabricates a background of wealth and prestige to maintain his constructed identity. He displays overconfidence in estimating his abilities of winning Daisy back, making him ignore Daisy’s dilemma. His fervent attitude in chasing the American dream makes him isolated. His relentless pursuit of the dream caused Daisy to abandon him and led him to his demise. Agamemnon shows concern with his image as he returns home. He seeks for power and greatness, but he is concerned of vengeance from the gods. He demonstrates overconfidence by killing his daughter, convinced it was a necessary act. He is confident that it’s the right decision, but he is blinded and unaware of the plotting inside the palace to kill him. Although so, he shows little isolation as he didn’t portray exaltation in his actions. His overconfidence and pride eventually led to his death, participating in his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results provide additional support for Owen’s application of Hubris syndrome (2008). The portrayal of Hubris Syndrome by the two characters suggests the recurring presence of such syndrome across fictional portrayals from different periods. Hubris syndrome is related with each of the characters’ tragic endings, suggesting that it could bring detrimental effects if not dealt with carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations-implications-and-further-research&#34;&gt;Limitations, Implications and Further Research
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations that should be considered. First, regarding internal validity, the content analysis was conducted by one person without peer discussions or cross- validation, making interpretations subjective and reducing the consistency of the findings. This also reduces reliability, as interpretations may differ if repeated by other researchers. In addition, the two passages selected were from western literature on male characters, making it not as generalizable to other cultures or gender perspectives, where hubristic traits could vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this still shows that hubris syndrome dominates the plot trajectories, illustrating that hubris syndrome plays a role in one’s tragic ending. Manifestations of the syndrome could also support its broad range of application, even in literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research could consider analysing hubristic syndrome in different cultures, for example, eastern culture or females to further broaden the applicability of findings. There could also be in depth interviews or discussions with one or more researchers to enhance the validity and reliability of interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the extent to which loss aversion varies across age and gender
in China. Employing an online, survey-based method, this study uses econometric
approaches (regression models and the utility function in stata) and examines Chinese people
of all ages and genders to assess loss aversion through mixed lottery questions. The findings
are inconsistent with the hypothesis, revealing that gender and age aren’t significantly related
to loss aversion. There seemed to be no significant differences between women and men,
although men are a bit more loss-averse than women. Older people are found to be more loss-
averse than younger people. These results contribute to the understanding of loss aversion in
a cultural context and provide new insights into gender differences. Questions and research
topics are proposed for further understanding and further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keywords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ： &lt;em&gt;Loss aversion, risk, gender, age, China, behavioral economics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction-and-literature-review&#34;&gt;1. Introduction and Literature review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss aversion, a phenomenon when a loss is viewed as more emotionally severe compared to
an equivalent game, is suggested by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Proposed in 1979,
this topic has become increasingly popular in research, producing dozens of studies in areas
such as finance, psychology, politics, and marketing. Loss aversion is key in every aspect of
our daily lives, since the extent of it, rather than its general occurrence, makes it a crucial
factor in decision-making (Schmidt, 2002). By understanding the mechanisms of loss
aversion, insights on human behavior can be recognised and strategies for mitigating its
impact can be developed. This study aims to dive back into the nature of loss aversion,
investigating how age and gender factors interact with it, shaping each individual’s responses
in acting towards losses in the context of China. By looking into the findings, the study can
provide a more nuanced understanding of decision-making and new insights.
The relationship between loss aversion and age and gender is a popular research area, not to
mention the numerous other research studies on abundant factors impacting loss aversion.
The mechanisms of loss aversion have already been widely explored. But turning back to the
basics of loss aversion, Gächter points out the effect of socio-demographic variables on loss
aversion, stating that it increases with age, income, and wealth and decreases with education
(2021). However, inconsistencies have arisen, debating the significance the variables have on
loss aversion, especially gender. Gächter (2021) claims that gender differences aren’t
significant in loss aversion while other studies report that female participants have shown a
higher degree of loss aversion than male participants (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari,
2015). Such arguments have led to the confusion of whether loss aversion was really affected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by gender- if so, to what extent? Heated debates on the gender differences in risk preferences
and loss aversion have led to several hypotheses and explanations and numerous research
results. This study hopes to provide a point and use the results to verify one’s own theory. On
the other hand, the variable age has been mostly consistent among various studies, asserting
that older people show a higher frequency of loss aversion than young adults (Arora and
Kumari, 2015; Gächter, 2021; Albert and Duffy, 2012), and so has education and income
(Gächter, 2021; Blake, Cannon and Wright, 2021), although there has been a lack of
explanation of why was age correlated with loss aversion. How these socio-demographic
factors influence loss aversion have been conducted numerous times in different countries, in
areas such as the US, India, and Germany respectively (Albert and Duffy, 2012; Arora and
Kumari, 2015; Gächter, 2021; Schmidt, 2002). Nevertheless, a paucity of research appeared
in the area of China, leading to uncharted questions: are the factors consistent between each
country? Do different cultures shape individuals’ choices differently? Wang et al. show that
different cultures do shape individuals’ choices, changing the way they perceive risks (2016).
The divergence of Chinese culture from others might impact their decision-making, making
this study wonder how and why it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-methodology&#34;&gt;2. Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-hypothesis&#34;&gt;2.1 Hypothesis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the studies done before, the study came up with two hypotheses.
Supposing the results of most countries are consistent, the findings should be similar to those
of the other studies. This study believed that: first, age is positively correlated with loss
aversion, meaning that the older people get, the more loss averse they are. Second, gender is
significantly correlated with loss aversion, and female participants show a larger extent of
loss aversion than male participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-experiment-design&#34;&gt;2.2 Experiment design
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used a survey approach and sent questionnaires through social media platforms.
Wenjuanxing, a popular and convenient website in China for making surveys and collecting
results was used. The participants were selected from different provinces in China, though
most were in Beijing. In a total of 100 participants, 56 males and 44 females volunteered to
participate. They varied around age, with children concentrating mostly on high school
students while adults were scattered between the ages of 20 and 80. They weren’t given any
remunerations or refreshments after finishing the survey. The time they used was short, under
5 minutes, and they relied on their senses, not using any help from the internet or friends. The
data was collected and saved on Wenjuanxing, enabling later access. The data were then
downloaded onto Excel for further processing and were analyzed by Stata.
The participants all took the same survey, first asking for mostly background questions,
determining variables such as age, gender, education level, and income level. Then a set of
loss aversion questions were given out (see Appendix 1). The participants had to choose
between receiving no money or having half the probability of receiving money (100 RMB)
and the other half losing money (starting with 90 and gradually decreasing to 10 RMB). To
confirm the predictions and exclude errors, three more questions measuring loss aversion
were set (Appendix 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No exact model was used to measure loss aversion. This study used the combination
of a few different methods in the hope of attaining more accurate results. In the first part, loss
aversion is determined by the participant switching point and the total score in deciding to
participate in the game; in the second part, loss aversion is determined by the total score of
the three questions. The greater the total scores were, the more loss averse they were in the
second part (3 as lowest and 6 as highest) and the less they were in the first part (9 as lowest
and 18 as full marks). These scores are then regressed with the variables using Stata,
calculating their p-values. To ensure credibility, the loss aversion coefficient for the first part
was also measured and regressed with stata. The calculation of this model was a simplified
version of Kahneman and Tversky’s model for measuring loss aversion. It was calculated
using the two utility functions for gains and losses respectively. Due to the lack of data in
calculating the values for alpha and beta in the utility function, this was simplified into a
linear model for more convenient measures.&lt;/p&gt;
$$
U(x) = x^{\alpha} \quad (x &gt; 0)
$$&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
U(x) = -\lambda (-x)^{\beta} \quad (x &lt; 0)

          &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 100 effective responses. With the wide range of age (14 to 80, with the
mean age around 37.4), it was split into three groups, children, adults and elders to help
distinguish the differences. Children were below 18, adults ranged from 18 to 59, and elders
were 60 and above. Age and gender were independent variables, and education level and
income level were control variables (the two had a close mean value, 4.27 and 4.12).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average amount of money willing to lose during the first part of the game (the
turning point) was 59.8 and the average of the score in the second part was 4.770. There were
some inconsistencies between the first and second part, as the less loss averse participants
weren’t mostly the ones who chose to participate in games in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependent variables (Loss Aversion total score in part 1, the Turning point, Loss
Aversion coefficient, Loss Aversion total score in part 2 respectively) in the table actually
shows that loss aversion isn’t related significantly with gender and age. The other socio-
demographic factors, such as education and income level also isn’t significantly related with
loss aversion, the p-value being larger than 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the calculation of the loss aversion coefficient, the elders were the most
loss averse, showing the highest average loss aversion coefficient (3.904), then the adults
(2.752), and lastly the children (2.524). However, the loss aversion coefficient of male
participants (2.89 7 ) were higher than those of female participants (2.60 2 ), showing that males
were actually more loss averse than females. No significant pattern of income level or
education level was found in loss aversion habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four participants were considered as the extreme of loss aversion, as they didn’t
choose to participate in the first part of the survey at all and had a greater average score of
loss aversion in the second part (5.250). 3 of 4 the participants considered as extreme were
male, while other variables showed no obvious pattern. 33 participants were considered as
slightly less loss averse, having a total score of 18 in the first part and a score of 4.576 in the
second part, showing no significant pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-discussion&#34;&gt;4. Discussion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multiple methods of analysis, it was concluded that the hypothesis was wrong:
age and gender are not significantly correlated with loss aversion. However, the average
value of the loss coefficient proved that older people were more loss-averse than younger
people, and men were more loss-averse than men. Such findings were inconsistent with other
studies. This study then aims to provide new insights, giving out reasons and suggesting why
the results weren’t significantly correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-gender-and-loss-aversion&#34;&gt;4.1 Gender and loss aversion.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study are inconsistent Schmidt’s’ and the others. Gender has no
significant correlation with loss aversion and by looking at extreme values and the
comparison of loss aversion coefficient, women tend to be less loss averse than men. In most
studies, though, women are explained to be more loss-averse than men because they exhibit
less risk-taking actions than men. According to the evolutionary explanation suggested by
Trivers and extended by Buss, women have a higher biological investment in producing
offsprings due to gestation and birth, giving them a more cautious approach to giving birth,
making them less risk-taking. On the contrary, men have a lower biological investment,
highly increasing their reproduction success by having sex with multiple mates. This could
derive from their risk-taking behavior since they’d gain more resources (2019). Today&amp;rsquo;s
choices can still stem from biological roots, making women more loss-averse since the losses
they have to consider wouldn’t be equal to their gains. The findings shown by Harris and
Jekins match up with this theory (2023), and the results of a lot of other studies are consistent
with the theory (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this study, though, refute this hypothesis. The perception that men are
more risk-taking than women due to innate reasons could be wrong. Born as a general
species, homo-sapiens, they might not have any risk preferences or loss preferences at the
start. Biological needs for survival could be the foundation but not the main reason for loss
aversion. It is further education, stereotypes that highly contrasts the difference between men
and women, lead to a subconscious thought (women are more loss averse than men),
therefore framing them and increasing the difference between genders. But nowadays, with
the advocates of gender equality, the ideas that women can do anything men can, and
education with no discrimination, the perceived difference between men and women might
decrease, leading to no significant divergence or correlation in gender differences and loss
aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a hypothesis is similar to Solvic’s. Solvic comes up with a different explanation
than the evolutionary theory for gender differences. He states that women engage more in
risk-taking activities than men because they are more familiar with these risks than men.
Women often face societal expectations and pressures, forming their risk attitude. Cultural
contexts can also influence how different genders respond to risks (1987). In China,
traditional thoughts such as gender roles highlight the significance of women as caregivers,
and housewives, fostering a more risk-averse mindset since they are supposed to prioritize
the well-being of others. Men are considered breadwinners, cultivating a more risk-taking
attitude since ambition and assertion are required to make money. Psychological factors also
suggest that gender differences tend to contribute to divergent outcomes. Women tend to put
a greater emphasis on the potential negative outcomes compared with men, making them
more loss-averse and less risk-taking. Solvic believes that it is the familiarity with risks that
makes women engage in social risks more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, such findings in this study don’t match up with the explanations. This could
be possible due to the prevalence of feminism, encouraging gender equality. Hu and Scott
reported that people’s attitudes toward gender roles prescribing a traditional gender division
of labor had significantly less support in China (2016). Traditional ideas of gender roles and
patrilineal thoughts are continuously challenged, implying that women face less societal
pressures and are encouraged to participate more fully in the workforce. This could increase
women’s risk-taking attitude, perhaps leading to less loss-averse choices. With societal norms
increasing equality, education, and job opportunities, and prevailing new ideas, perhaps men
would feel challenged or turn to a new way of thinking, decreasing their willingness to take
risks, and making them more loss-averse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-age-and-loss-aversion&#34;&gt;4.2 Age and loss aversion.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings in the results do, in a way, show that older people are more loss averse,
because the loss aversion coefficient found in the results do confirm the hypotheses made.
Although so, the regression results propose the contrary idea, showing a negative, and non-
significant correlation with loss aversion. This could be due to the different emphasis each
model has. Considering only on the aspect of comparing the loss aversion coefficient,
Guttman and other researchers reports that age influences loss aversion, as it is correlated
with the thickness of PCC (Posterior cingulate cortex), a brain region that controls decision
making (2021). In their study, the thickness of PCC declines with age, affecting older
people’s decision making and increasing their loss aversion (Guttman, Ghahremani, Pochon,
Dean and London, 2021). Studies confirm their hypothesis, reporting an increase of loss
aversion with the increase of age (Schmidt, 2002; Arora and Kumari, 2015). Part of the
results of this study proves their explanation. Another implied answer could be the
Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST), suggesting that people prioritize different goals
based on their perception of time (Löckenhoff, 2011). Older people with a shorter perceived
future might focus in the present, making the losses seem more impactful. They also focus on
their emotions more, meaning that the emotional impact of losses could be a devastating blow
for them than for younger people. But this explanation is a mere hypothesis, there still is a
lack of the explanation of why there are age differences in loss aversion. Some studies might
not be completely explainable for the results found in this study. Further research is required
in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;43-loss-aversion-and-others&#34;&gt;4.3 Loss aversion and others
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though age and gender and many other factors are said to affect loss aversion,
people with different emotions, personalities, growing environments could make choices
inconsistently. It is found that factors like the distribution of religion, individualism and
masculinity can all have an indifference in loss aversion between gender effect on loss
aversion (Wang, Rieger, Hens, 2016). Even after controlling variables, areas in Europe
showed more loss aversion and areas like America showed less (Wang, et al. 2016). Studies
in different geographic locations could lead to inconsistent findings. Chinese people value
collectivism more, perhaps having a cushioning effect in the society after taking risks,
decreasing their differences in loss aversion (Hsee and Weber, 1999). Americans might value
individualism more, gaining a more unique personality, leading to significant differences in
findings. Loss aversion also depends on psychological and emotional factors, and neural
studies show that emotional regulations can alter assessments and choices decisions,
impacting loss aversion (Sokol-Hessner, Camerer, Phelps, 2013). With numerous variables
impacting loss aversion, it’s hard controlling variables such as masculinity, personality and
such, perhaps leading to a small inconsistency with other studies in the final results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-conclusion&#34;&gt;5. Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses mainly on influence of age and gender on loss aversion in China. The
results show that there’s no significant relationships between age and loss aversion and
gender and loss aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-limitations&#34;&gt;5.1 Limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few limitations in the study, one being the lack of participants. Compared
to some studies, the number of participants was enough, but there wasn’t an even amount of
distribution in age. Although the age range was wider than other studies (Arora and Kumari,
2015), the number of participants in some age ranges, elders for example, was lacking, which
might lead to not-so-representative findings. This could also lead to, as mentioned before, a
difference between the pattern and the correlation shown in the regression, since averaging
the entire group may mask each response, and a lack of data could lead to some errors. The
number of people in different provinces in China is also uneven, and since geographic factors
could affect gender differences in loss aversion (Solvic, 1987), perhaps the results in mostly
Beijing couldn’t represent the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants’ response is also something that could be improved. During the
experiment, a few responses weren’t logically correct, as they presented an answer of
agreeing to participate in higher levels of risk and giving up on lower levels of risk. Their
answers were then deleted and new participants were asked to do the survey. Although errors
like these were eliminated, it is hard to promise that every participant wasn’t rushing through
it. This could be due to the absence of remunerations and refreshments for participants, since
most studies had them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for more adequate word choices during the design of questionnaires could
be a problem. An inadequate design might imply demand characteristics, meaning that the
title and word choices could subconsciously alter the decisions participants make. A
phenomenon was discovered after the survey spread- a few participants claimed that they
were ‘a gambler’ (in the survey). The participants could interpret such a survey as measuring
risk attitudes, suggesting that they might have tried to incline to the gamble to fit the
perceived purpose of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-implications-and-further-research&#34;&gt;5.2 Implications and Further Research
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study still hold some questions unanswered. The analyses of the
results gave some answers but also presented some gaps. Studies could focus on the
relationship of age with risk aversion and loss aversion and the reason why they were related.
Much could be implied about the cultural difference that influences loss aversion- the results
were different in China than it was in India and the US, was it due to the cultural
environment, history it had, the economy, or the political environment? How much is gender
and age correlated with loss aversion? Is the significance of these factors larger than religious
beliefs, emotions, and wealth? The relationships between risk-taking and loss aversion—how
are they related? Does the factors that influence one subject influence another? Would the
effect be any different? To make sure results were consistent and accurate, there could be an
improvement in this study by increasing the accuracy and preciseness of survey questions,
the number of participants, and other effective variables.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/self-determination-theory/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a psychological view, self-determination means the result or process of acting under one’s own choice, ‘particularly to behaviours that improves one’s circumstance’ (APA dictionary of psychology, 2018; Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Self-determination is useful in overcoming fears, giving humans the courage to achieve more, as did Jerry when going through the tunnel (Lessing, 1957), bringing him growth and maturity. For adolescents, or even young children like Jerry, self-determination could help them make vocational decisions, informed choices, and increase independence (Field, Hoffman, Posch 1997). Increased motivation and satisfaction of three fundamental needs also increases self- determination, helping ones to persevere through challenges. Elouise Cobell presents such characteristic when going against the U.S. government, fighting for the rights of the Blackfoot tribe, bringing justice eventually (Janko, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is linked with motivation, which is performed through the fulfilment of three fundamental needs. It is highly valued for the benefit it brings and is becoming increasingly important in our everyday lives. The three fundamental needs, competence, relatedness and autonomy is shown to increase motivation. These are shown to be important since it fosters innovation, engagement, wellbeing and allows us to adapt in the constant change of opportunities. (Souders, 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination is a crucial factor in personal growth, as it empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Fulfilling the fundamental needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness fosters motivation, gives rise to self-determination and fosters personal growth. This essay is going to look at self-determination in the aspects of the three fundamental needs and motivation, and its implications in the education context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand the self-determination theorem, the concepts of the three fundamental needs should be defined. Autonomy means to have freedom and be in control of one’s own choice, which affirms their inner thoughts (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Being in control of one’s own choices could give out energy, and wholeness, and avoid self-fragmentation, useful in developmental stages (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Relatedness means the need to be connected with others, to feel belonging and responsibility in a group (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Achieving a sense of belonging could be helpful for individuals, gaining support, resources, and attachment (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Competence means how prepared a person is for the task to achieve wanted outcomes (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). According to Deci and Ryan (2010), competence is important because a person willing to learn would be actively seeking knowledge, and open to new cultures and new things, providing them with social interaction or survival, while those with little competence could be ill-prepared for future situations. Each of these needs, positive or negative, are all important to enhance self-determination. Jerry as a character in Lessing’s short story “Through the Tunnel” demonstrates self- determination in going through the tunnel. This is manifested by the three fundamental needs. Jerry experiences a strong desire for social connection which fits the definition of relatedness in the self-determination theory, as evidenced by his isolation from his peers and his yearning to belong to the group of older boys. However, their rejection after he discovers his inability to follow them through the tunnel deepens his sense of isolation. The desire for belonging with the older boys increases fuels his drive and wants to go through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessing highlights Jerry&amp;rsquo;s development of competence through his preparations. He demonstrates initiative by requesting goggles from his mother and practices breath control with such dedication that his nose bleeds. These actions showcase his growing confidence and acquired skills. After gaining the confidence and preparations needed to go through the tunnel, this increases his willingness to do so. Additionally, Jerry exhibits autonomy throughout his endeavor. He makes independent choices, acting without his mother&amp;rsquo;s interference, and ultimately chooses to confront his fear by entering the tunnel on his own volition. This motivates him and moves him towards the act of going through the tunnel. These fundamental factors all enhances motivation, which in turn contributes to his self-determination, giving him the vitality to go through the hole, to continue even if he’s facing obstacles and challenges, and eventually overcome the fear of going through the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory postulates that the satisfaction of the three fundamental needs sustains intrinsic motivation. According to Patall and Cooper ( 2008 ), given the freedom of choice, intrinsic motivation could increase because of the increased willingness to do so. Autonomy fosters intrinsic motivation. This is apparent when students are allowed to participate in activities they find interesting, challenging, or unfamiliar (Núñez &amp;amp; León, 2015). Relatedness, gaining support from students, and feeling connected tend to increase motivation (Ryan &amp;amp; Powelston, 1991). Gaining enough satisfaction from peers might foster a sense of belonging, so one might get the sense that doing so again could make them feel the sense of belonging again, making them more determined and increasing their motivation. Although competence beliefs are not shown to be too highly correlated with intrinsic motivation, certain experiences could affect both factors, increasing confidence and interests, and willingness to learn (Spinath &amp;amp; Steinmayr, 2008). As stated by Dysvik and Gagne, one hypothesis was that the needs worked in synergy, and the satisfaction of the two needs, relatedness and autonomy, or autonomy and competence could all enhance intrinsic motivation. Although competence wasn’t a main factor for increasing intrinsic motivation, it acted as an essence for intrinsic motivation (Dysvik &amp;amp; Gagne, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is also reported that autonomous motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, are the bases of self-determination, and promotes self-determination, influencing the well-being and the engagement of individuals (Main, 2023; Deci and Ryan, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with self-determination, autonomous motivation is when a person behaves in a way governed by oneself with internal or integrated motivation. “Intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000), giving oneself more choice and interests in doing something. Integration happens when people adopt a value or regulation by others and believe it, following the rule, believing that it is crucial to their goal or it’s their own choice to do so (Deci, 1994). These two ways of motivation leads individuals to autonomously pursue these values because they are aligned with their personal goals and interests, contributing to autonomous motivation. Elouise Cobell, shows autonomous motivation in standing up for what she believes is right, advocating rights for the Blackfeet tribe (Janko, 2013). The internal sense of justice and control of her rights perhaps fuelled her and motivated her to act. Her connection and belongingness to the tribe could also have been a factor. These intrinsic motivational factors made her continue restlessly for what she did until she passed away. Autonomous motivation has its benefits in other aspects such as gaining psychological wellbeing, continuing a healthy habit, promoting the whole wellbeing of a society (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2012 ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled motivation, on the other hand, is when a person behaves in a way due to external factors or introjection. “Extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome.” (Deci &amp;amp; Ryan, 2000). Introjection happens when taking in values from others while not truly internalizing it as one’s own. This could be due to external pressures and could result in feelings such as guilt or anxiety (Deci, 1994). These are shown to lower autonomy, resulting in lowered self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-determination theory is applied in multiple aspects such as education, nursing, sports and work. In education, self-determination theory is applied in online learning, teachers and students to research why students are motivated to learn and how to provide a better environment to foster self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multiple researches, the researchers focus on the three basic needs and motivation in education. When the three basic needs of self-determination theory are met, the students are more likely to be engaged in school. Earl reported that students with the highest satisfaction of the three needs experienced the most achievement, engagement and had most positive effects (2019). Autonomous goals and motivation is also an evident factor in education, affecting their behaviours. Guay reports that autonomous motivation results in more positive outcomes, and pursuing autonomous goals could increase motivation, creating a positive cycle for improving education behaviours (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the academic achievements and perseverance of students, programs promoting motivation or fulfilling the three basic needs are encouraged to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting and increasing autonomy is one way. Reeve, develops an experiment where teachers receive training on autonomy support, achieving the answer that the more autonomy given to students by teachers, the more engaged they were (2004). Chiu does something similar with the during the context of online learning, showing that “students feel a stronger sense of autonomy to choose their preferred technologies to learn with, a stronger sense of competence to access online learning, and a stronger sense of relatedness to connect with teachers for communication.”(Chiu, 2021) Chiu’s research also supports the claim that increasing fundamental needs of students could increase their engagement, emphasizing that teachers should fully satisfy the three needs of the students to increase their motivation. Su and Reeve suggest there are a few ways to foster autonomy support such as considering students’ perspectives, avoiding the use of controlling language, encouraging them to solve their problems; giving out instruction manuals, providing knowledge and training to mostly teachers (especially those just beginning their career or not so familiar with fostering self- determination), and a short follow-up after training (2010). Such programs should be encouraged to be implemented because it increases the autonomy of the students, and could be easily done online or offline. Such programs mostly have a positive effect, although the duration is unknown. There are a few limitations in the program, such as the sample size, and it should try to be implemented into more environments, such as home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs focusing on enhancing the needs in different subjects are also experimented. Two programs, the Reading within Family and School program and the CASIS-Écriture training program (cooperation, authentic activities, support for autonomy, involvement, and structure) are used to enhance their reading and writing skills respectively. The first program intervened in school and family environments to encourage reading, to further enhance their curiosity and willingness to read. Through the process, their autonomy and readiness is rising, which leads to the increase of intrinsic motivation. The study showed that intervening highly increased their engagement, having a five-month lasting effect. The second focused on motivation and writing, providing CASIS training courses for teachers. The study showed that trained teachers gave students more autonomous motivation in writing compared with controlled students. Providing extra training in school environments for teachers or giving out a free, supportive environment at home are all useful in promoting motivation, giving rise to self-determination. These subject based researches are useful in increasing motivation for reading and writing, although the CASIS program had a limited increase in children’s autonomous motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;increasing-self-determination&#34;&gt;Increasing self-determination
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deci acknowledges that “providing a rationale, acknowledging feelings, and conveying choice are relevant for promoting internalization” (Deci,1994). From the programs used to implement self-determination, it is inferred that creating an environment where one provides one’s thoughts, gives enough freedom for choice, and acknowledges their feelings values their opinions is crucial. Controlling words should also be minimized. This supports integration and intrinsic motivation, further fuelling self-determination and helping personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only so, but people should also be intent on discovering their basic needs to promote intrinsic motivation. To achieve such needs, allowing oneself the freedom of choice and letting one decide what to do in even the smallest of things, such as what to wear could increase autonomy. Giving oneself a challenge and allowing oneself to learn new skills necessary for the challenge could help increase competence, and creating more connections within the society could increase relatedness, increasing determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academic studies, especially, parents or schools should provide environments that provide little external forces. They should give children more choices, allow children to develop their interests, provide favourable challenges (e.g. speech competitions), and give out positive and constructive feedback. In case there is little intrinsic motivation, parents or schools should also let children understand the values of activities they don’t like, such as providing rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although so, it should be acknowledged that different personalities and cultural beliefs could all shape ones’ behavior, limiting their ability of making decisions (Main, 2023), so implementing the same ways to everyone may not be all effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-determination theory offers a structure for understanding self-determination in personal growth and the roles of the basic needs and motivation. As discussed, self- determination, fueled by autonomous motivation and the fulfillment of core needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), empowers individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their full potential. Using examples from Lessing and Janko, understanding the differences and uses of each motivation, and the connections between these factors, environments that nurture self-determination can be created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Dolly the Sheep to Snuppy the Dog, pet cloning is gaining more attention, and the number of people who are considering using this technique to resurrect their pet is climbing. Since commencing operations in 2015, Viagen, a company specializing in pet cloning, has reported an increase in the number of cloning procedures performed. The company has disclosed completing hundreds of procedures to date (Dimitropoulos, 2022). But is this the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet cloning has its ups and downs. This article evaluates the value it has in a scientific view. To sum it up, the merits of pet cloning are controversial in the scientific community, with the main points of the dispute being the process&amp;rsquo;s efficiency, the long-term health implications for cloned animals, and reprogramming considerations surrounding the SCNT technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inefficient-process&#34;&gt;Inefficient Process
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloning of animals typically utilizes the SCNT (Somatic cell nuclear transfer) technique . The cloning process starts with harvesting the skin cell from the donor animal. The cell is then fused an unfertilized egg removed from the female of the same species with the nucleus (containing DNA) taken away. Fusing the two cells with an electric pulse jump starts cell division, eventually resulting in an embryo. During the early stage, the embryo is impla nted surgically in the surrogate mother. It carries the cloned pregnancies and gives birth to the cloned animal. Though the steps may seem easy, problems occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, cloning has a low success rate. Th e main reason of the l ow success rate could be due to the failure of the development of embryos. In laboratories, only a few cells have developed to become fetuses. After that, “a high rate of fetal, perina tal, and neonatal loss ” is reported (Hare, 2003, p. 271) . Out of the emb ryos implanted into the wombs of 13 sheep, only Dolly survived. (Elsner, 2006) This contributes to the low success rate of cloning, requiring improvements. A low success rate of cloning, supported by Ko’s research, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign ’s College of Veterinary Medicine, claimed that the success rate of cloning dogs is around 20 percent (Brogan, 2018). Although quite high compared with cloning other animals, the success rate still implies that trying to clone 100 dogs could mean failure in the other 80, wasting 80% of the lives of cloned animals. According to Dr. Smith, the reason of low success rat e cou ld be due to the dogs having unique reprodu ctive cycles and involving a considerable number of genes (Brogan, 2018). This requires further research and could be improved until the technology is commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, t he process wastes numerous a nimals, eggs, and embryos. Snuppy, the cloned dog, and his twin came from the three pregnan cies, 1,000 embryos implanted into 123 surrogates. Snuppy and his twin was the outcome of the three pregnancies of more than 1,000 embryos implanted into the 123 sur rogates. Brogan claims, “You need a good number of dogs to do this type of cloning, ” (2018, para. 17) implying that the process is extremely wasteful. Elsner agrees by claiming that with dolly, “the 277 attempts to fuse an adult sheep cell nucleus with an egg, only 27 embryos developed normally for a week.” (2006 , p. 597). This process wastes a tremendous amount of eggs, and embryos, surpassing those in natural reproduction. (Elsner, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;health-and-longevity-p-roblems&#34;&gt;Health and Longevity P roblems
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the hardships of turning into a fetus, cloned animals encounter more trouble. Following birth, clon ed offspring might not survive. During the 24h of birth, clones could die due to “ respiratory distress; increased birth weight; or cardiovascular anomalies, some of which have resulted in hypertrophic liver and dilated major blood vessels. ”(Hare, 2003, p.271) The lives of the clone ends abruptly , just after they’re born .Even if they do survive, pets might age faster or have a higher risk of obtain ing diseases. The fact that the c hromosomes taken from th e donor , shorter than normal , might give clones a shorter life span. Donors could have defects in their organs, which co uld pass on to cloned animals. Dolly, for example, died at six, which was half the lifespan of an average sheep. The mice cloned from somatic cells died early , and their lifespan was reported to be shorter than the genotype, presenting the possibility of the such technology’s long -term detrimental effects (Ogonuki, 2002). However, Bu rgstaller ’s (2017) research provides an opposing view. O ther sheep that were cloned with the same cell line as Dolly lived close to their natural lifespan. The maximum lifespan of most animals cloned (such as mice, sheep, cats, and dogs) has been proven to reach their natural lifespans, although the cloned lifespan of oth er species has yet to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim reported that the health Snuppy , the first cloned dog, was monitored throughout its life. Notably, both Snuppy and the dog that provided the genetic mat erial (cell donor) developed cancer at similar ages. Reclones of Snuppy are not expected to age in an accelerated speed nor would the y exhibit a greater tendency of develop ing diseases than naturally bred animals (Kim, 2017). The reason of why Dolly lived shorter while Snuppy didn’t is unanswered. The health and longevity of cloned animals are still uncertain and additional research could be made to refine the answer to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scnt---reprogramming-and-a-dvancements&#34;&gt;SCNT - Reprogramming and A dvancements
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades -old, the SCNT process was widely used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning and has been applied to the cloning of a variety of animals, such as pigs, goats, cats, and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the success rate is very low, 3.4% -13% for each embryo transferre d, and even lower, 0.3% -1.7% for a reconstructed oocyte (Burgstaller, 2017). The efficiency varies bet ween 0.1% - 16% (Srirattana, 2022), though recent technology is said to have improved the efficiency, and further refinements would be made to SCNT to make better use of it (Matoba, 2018). Numerous approaches to increase efficiency have been utilized in oocytes, cloned embryos, and cell d onors (Srirattana , 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still barriers to the reprogramming of genes, such as genome instability and incomplete reprogramming , with the latter causing problems abnormalities such as large birth weight, unusual organ size, respiratory problems, and weakened immune systems (Gouveia, 2020). It should be noted though, that different species could exhibit different problems. Bovine clones could become obese, while pig clones would be concerned with underweight and underdeveloped placenta problems, an d murine clones would be i nvolved with abnormal placentas (Gouveia, 2020) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somatic cell nuclear transfer has potential, but there are still problems to overcome such as low efficiency, and reprogramming difficulties leading to abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though numerous people are willing to resurrect their pets using cloning, there could be potential drawbacks. The efficiency and the health of the clones are still debatable, which would vary depending on different species, different donors, and different techniques used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Somatic Cell Nuclear T ransfer technology is still developing, and is beneficial in ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such as cloning animals to keep their highly valued traits, increasing numbers of endangered species, or creating transgenic animals for medical u se (Sumer, 2009), it is questionable whether pet cloning is worth it. Dr. Robert Klitzman (2018) , Columbia University ’s academic director of the master of sci ence in bioethics program speaks out his concerns that the use of pet cloning isn’t beneficial to the health of people or pets, and claims that such operations should only be implemented if it increases the advancement of medical and scientific research. While some people see pet cloning as a way to cope with the loss of a beloved pet, it should raise concerns about its little scientific value, ethical implications and accessibility only to those with significant financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
