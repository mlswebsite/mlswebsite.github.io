      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;摘要&#34;&gt;摘要&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the evolving relationship between Evelyn and her daughter Joy in Everything Everywhere All at Once. We seek to answer the following question: Why does the relationship between Evelyn and her daughter undergo such a dramatic transformation?  The study analyzes such question through the theoretical lenses of structuralism and Hegelian dialectics, ultimately concluding that the root of the mother-daughter conflict lies in the failure of the Symbolic Order to fully symbolize the Real. Specifically, when facing the collapse of the symbolic order, Evelyn&amp;rsquo;s initial coping strategy - relying on &amp;lsquo;fantasy&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;adding signifiers that slips along the signifying chain&amp;rsquo; to suppress surplus - inevitably produces more surplus, as symbolization always generates new remnants. The excessive use of symbolization leads to the &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; of the subject. Evelyn’s resolution comes not through violently repressing surplus (her daughter’s loss of control), but through facing the surplus, and turning towards containment and symbiosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hubristic syndrome Assessing its literary applications through The Great Gatsby and Agamemnon</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the ancient tragedies of Greece to the modern-day downfalls of business tycoons and political leaders, the concept of hubris has served as a cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked power. The theme hubris was already apparent in Greek tragedies, where it mostly meant disrespecting the gods by not crediting ones’ success or fortune to the gods (Marquez, 2015), often leading to nemesis (divine retribution) and ate (ruin). The meaning of hubris has then evolved into excessive arrogance and over-confidence that leads to self-destruction (Marquez, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attitude Towards Loss Aversion: The Differences Across Age and Gender in China</title>
      <link>https://mlswebsite.github.io/post/attitude-towards-loss-aversion/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the extent to which loss aversion varies across age and gender&#xA;in China. Employing an online, survey-based method, this study uses econometric&#xA;approaches (regression models and the utility function in stata) and examines Chinese people&#xA;of all ages and genders to assess loss aversion through mixed lottery questions. The findings&#xA;are inconsistent with the hypothesis, revealing that gender and age aren’t significantly related&#xA;to loss aversion. There seemed to be no significant differences between women and men,&#xA;although men are a bit more loss-averse than women. Older people are found to be more loss-&#xA;averse than younger people. These results contribute to the understanding of loss aversion in&#xA;a cultural context and provide new insights into gender differences. Questions and research&#xA;topics are proposed for further understanding and further research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Self Determination Theory</title>
      <link>https://mlswebsite.github.io/post/self-determination-theory/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a psychological view, self-determination means the result or process of acting under one’s own choice, ‘particularly to behaviours that improves one’s circumstance’ (APA dictionary of psychology, 2018; Merriam-Webster, n.d.). Self-determination is useful in overcoming fears, giving humans the courage to achieve more, as did Jerry when going through the tunnel (Lessing, 1957), bringing him growth and maturity. For adolescents, or even young children like Jerry, self-determination could help them make vocational decisions, informed choices, and increase independence (Field, Hoffman, Posch 1997). Increased motivation and satisfaction of three fundamental needs also increases self- determination, helping ones to persevere through challenges. Elouise Cobell presents such characteristic when going against the U.S. government, fighting for the rights of the Blackfoot tribe, bringing justice eventually (Janko, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Dolly the Sheep to Snuppy the Dog, pet cloning is gaining more attention, and the number of people who are considering using this technique to resurrect their pet is climbing. Since commencing operations in 2015, Viagen, a company specializing in pet cloning, has reported an increase in the number of cloning procedures performed. The company has disclosed completing hundreds of procedures to date (Dimitropoulos, 2022). But is this the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
