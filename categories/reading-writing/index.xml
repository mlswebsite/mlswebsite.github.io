      <title>鼠疫 （The Plague）</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;《鼠疫》是加缪写在一九四几年写的小说，讲述了一座小城市突然被鼠疫这个病入侵，封城后人们一系列的举动。&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;鼠疫带来的不仅仅是病痛和死亡，还有对于在平庸的小镇过着平庸的生活的人们翻天覆地的变化。鼠疫的到来是荒谬的，疫情从简简单单一只死去的老鼠逐渐演变成了要封城的地步，人们离奇死亡；鼠疫的离开更是荒谬的，它看似随着时间的流逝消失的无影无踪；有些人幸运的从病痛中恢复了，有些人却为此付出了生命的代价。人们平庸的生活却被这一事件打破，在面对如此近距离的死亡后，他们逐渐开始思考生命的意义，开始思考如何面对“荒谬”。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pearl (Movie) Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She is highly sympathetic yet also disturbingly unhinged. She’s trapped in a suffocating environment after the first world war, burdened with caring for her paralyzed father and living under her mother’s strict authority. Yet she dreams to be a star- a dancer that will one day famous, like such in the Hollywood movies.&#xA;At the beginning of the film, Pearl admires herself in the mirror. She believes that the image in the mirror (her ideal self) is the sweet, glamorous movie star (yet the role is acutally shaped by the American Dream). It kinda feels like ‘the mirror stage’ Lacan mentioned. During this stage, infants recognize themselves in the mirror. The reflected self appears whole and unified, but the actual self is fragmented and uncoordinated. From this gap, the infant constructs an ‘ideal ego,’ a seemingly complete and coherent self-image. Pearl believes that herself in the mirror is a star, yet it is found on misrecognition, as Pearl can never become the cinematic ideal she chases.  She refuses to believe it, yet her mother’s words and her failed audition keeps reminding her that she never will become the Hollywood star she imagines herself to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WORK IN PROGRESS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;October 1st&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s been five months since she died. People still look at me as if I’m some question they’re too polite to ask. I sit quiet during the funeral, my black shirt swaying with the wind. The wind blows; it howls, seemingly mourning for my encounter. Besides the wind, everything else was still. Guests shuffled around me, phrases of ‘everything happens for a reason’, ‘it’s a miracle you were spared’ ‘you have to move on’ passed into my ear. They were like droplets of rain, fragile, empty, and disappeared quickly. One ear in, out the other.&#xA;I guess everyone wanted me to believe that her death was a comma in some divine sentence, which I thought it wasn’t. It felt like a typo one made and didn’t care to change.&#xA;I met our parents. I see my mother dabbing her tears onto her handkerchief as if she could press them away. I saw my father lowering his head. I guess he didn’t want guests to see him crying. I sat beside them during the funeral. No words were exchanged.&#xA;I guess they rather wished it was me who died.&#xA;I did too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;我是一个看完影片就喜欢刷评论的人 。在看完《好想做一次》全四季后，我兴高采烈的去不同网站上翻评论和看点评去了。令我诧异的是，Devi（主角）这个角色的行为/性格包含争议：有些人很喜欢她，又有些人很讨厌她。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;黑塞一直是我最喜欢的一位作家之一。他的语言优美，字句之间透露出沉思者的气质。而且，他几乎所有的作品都围绕着“自我”这一主题展开——一个我始终感兴趣，也始终在思索的问题。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;最开始读过黑塞的德米安，感觉很有意思，又开始读起了他的荒原狼。感觉有点难，所以我又回到了他写的比较容易的书，在轮下中。 在表达我的感受前，我还是想先说一下黑塞。我很喜欢黑塞的书，虽然读完需要反复品味，但他的文笔优美，他的想法也很令人深思。我读了两遍德米安，和读完在轮下后一样，感觉每次都多少会有一些新的感悟。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Babel读后感</title>
      <link>https://mlswebsite.github.io/post/babel%E8%AF%BB%E5%90%8E%E6%84%9F/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently read Babel by R. F. Kuang, an amazing book. What I really loved was character development, the themes Kuang discussed, and how deeply the story resonates with me. At the heart of the novel is Robin, a Chinese student who is ‘adopted’ by Professor Lovell and sent to study translation at Oxford, in the institution known as Babel, during the 19th century. As Robin navigates life in a colonial world, he faces deep identity struggles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Screams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Blood curling screams. Blood that runs like a river. Flesh molded together. Tangled and scattered limbs. Achilles stood in front of him. The head of the spear flew close to him. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. Then it was pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crucifying pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bronze dagger seemed to pierce through frozen time as it inched towards Hector’s abdominal. It burst right through his sides, and heat seemed to spread towards his whole body. He looked down and thought he’d seen red run up towards him. His eyes slowly closed as the ground rushed to greet him. Is this how it’s supposed to end? The hero, defender of Troy, lay slack on the grounds, as he watched the Greek trample down his home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ender’s Game movie review</title>
      <link>https://mlswebsite.github.io/post/enders-game-movie-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I was scrolling through movies, I came across Ender’s game. I haven’t read the book before, so my reviews are only on the movie and some comments and reviews others had on the book. The movie was about people training an army used to fight the Formics (sort of like ants), and Ender was the main character who’s destined to lead the team into winning the war. Personally, I believe that it was a good movie, although there were parts that I was confused with or could be better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fishbowl</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is life?&#xA;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a long road full of uncertainties and dwindling trails; it could be a vast ocean, waiting for you to venture far into the beyond; or it could be a box. A box filled with surprises. The Seville on Roxy is literally like a box. A box squished with people living their everyday lives.&#xA;The book gives readers a peek at the lives of residents in the building. Connor, who owns a gold fish named Ian, was cheating on Katie with Faye and Deb. After doing so, he realized that his only love was Katie, but it was too late. Katie found out. Devastated, she left and they broke up.&#xA;Petunia Delilah, on the other hand, is about to give birth to a baby. But there’s nobody home and her phone is out of battery. Meanwhile, Claire, staying her clean home and never leaving, had just lost her job. Herman, a boy is dealing with the fact that his only relative, grandpa passed away. Passed out on the hallway, he was found by Delilah searching for help. Claire helps by calling 911, and Herman helps deliver the baby. Unexpectedly, Claire find a new job and a date with the man on the other side of the phone.&#xA;Jimenez, the lonely maintenance in the building faces a challenge: fixing the elevator. He’s done a poor job, but it managed to work. Garth, another lonely soul, has a secret. He likes wearing dresses, the feeling of expensive fabric sliding against his skin, how it floats and dances when he spins, it makes him feel beautiful. Jimenez, sent to fix his skin finds out this secret. The two talks and a warm feeling, perhaps the feeling of understanding, acceptance, rises.&#xA;Lastly, Ian the goldfish leaves his fishbowl and goes on an adventure, plummeting down the building, and luckily, landing in Faye’s water bottle.&#xA;In a short 30 minutes, we have witnessed the birth of a new live, it’s heart pounding as it lays in Herman’s arms; we have witnessed the heartbreaks of two people, both crying and regretting their choices; we have witnessed the start of a relationship of two lovely men, dancing and relaxing; we have witnessed the short fall of Ian, finally free from his fishbowl out for an adventure.&#xA;People in this building has been through things, no matter good or bad. It happens, like a programmed robot finishing one step then starting another. No turning back, all we have to do is just take a step forward. Just like how Ian took a leap of out his fishbowl, it’s time for all of us to take a leap of faith. Take a step forward, down the road; hoist the sails and explore, see what adventure awaits; or perhaps just start by choosing what to have for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
