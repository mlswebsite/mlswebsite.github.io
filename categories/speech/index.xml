        <title>Catching Butterflies</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Butterflies. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear it? It could be the butterfly fluttering in the meadow. But for me, it is the butterflies flying in my stomach. So now you might understand why this x-ray picture with butterflies is doing here. This, quite literally, is just having butterflies in your stomach. So why is it here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just begin with telling you what having ‘butterflies in your stomach’ means. This describes the nervous energy in your belly before or during situations where you might feel anxious or excited. I hate this feeling, but you see me standing here, which means I have caught some of them (grabs some of it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My middle school speech competition was still carved in my mind. I wrote my draft and learnt it by heart. While drawing the lot deciding who would go first, I came in second. Standing on the stage, looking at the referees while the coloured lights shone on my face, I could only hear my pounding heart and my brain who ushered me to say something. I couldn’t remember how I finished, though. I said whatever that immediately came to mind, and stammered my whole way through it. My head was hanging so low when I walked back to class, and I just couldn’t bear to think how I disappointed my teachers, classmates. They still cheered for me though, I was just being paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think— why do I have butterflies in my stomach? Why could the others say and act out everything so confidently while I kept on stammering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I look down from the stage, the pitch-black audience, I’d feel scared. Why? Well, I was near-sighted, so whenever I take off my glasses, I couldn’t see everyone’s expressions clearly, only a blurred outline. It might be my own mind, but the audiences’ faces seemed to transform into devilish grinning faces, waiting for me to make a joke of myself and laugh in my face after failure. My mind seemed to be surrounded with laughter, mockery, making my whole head blank and filled with worriedness. My true words were supressed and buried, and everything I said sounded so silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly can we get over stage fright and improve our confidence? That is a good question. I’m curious too, and to be honest, I don’t think that I have the exact answer. But I’d like to share my thoughts and hope you’d get inspired. There was this time when I had to speak in front of the class, and I was frightened. In my perspective, I did poorly. I was stammering, afraid to make eye contact and I kept forgetting my words, improvising as I went along. When I asked my friends how I did, they said I did well. I asked “I felt so nervous up there, couldn’t you feel it?” But they responded “you seemed so confident up there. You did great!” I gaped at their words. Were my wobbly legs, sweaty hands and pounding heart all an illusion? That’s when I realized it. It wasn’t. I felt it, real and true, but it wasn’t apparent in other people’s perspectives. Perhaps we’re all making a big deal of ourselves, especially the way we look in other people’s eyes. Was it, was it even possible in the slightest way that other contestants are just as awkward and nervous as me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was this scared, why would I go on stage and give a speech? Perhaps this was just a ritual of saying goodbye to the old, scared me. Perhaps I still haven’t got over stage fright, but, hey, at least I took a step forward. Awkward as it is, I finally managed to speak my thoughts out to all of you, and that’s enough. Could I regret this? I might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever we choose we are held responsible for it. No matter what the difficulty is, just brave it out and you’ll manage. The butterflies still appear in my stomach whenever I do something that gets me nervous, but I’m going to catch it, even if it means I have to do things I shrink from.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beauty of Books</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/beauty-of-books/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/beauty-of-books/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard a lot of unique topics, so I’m going to start with something common &amp;ndash; books. No matter text books we use for class, books we read outside of school for research, novels for relaxing… Books are woven into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the first time you read a book? I couldn’t. But that feeling was something I’d always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn’t take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. Books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Just like what Emily Dickinson said, “There is no Frigate like a Book; To take us Lands away”. Reading the books, I’ve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings. So much is said about fiction books, so some of you might wonder, what about nonfiction books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. If fiction books are exciting escapes, then non-fiction books are gateways to knowledge. Although I’m not a big fan of non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&amp;rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. I’ve heard an interesting book mentioned before by a college student. What was different from other books was that the author invited readers to challenge his thoughts and give out their own explanations, encouraging them to think. The whole books sounds interesting and I would’ve read it if I were better at physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read anything. But read it with a different mindset. I don’t think that a lot of us like the books we are told to read by mandarin teachers, especially for tests. There was once when we were supposed to read How the Steel was Tempered. I didn’t want to read it. But I got bored one day, so I just took a peek into that book. Okay. I was surprised. The content was completely different from what I thought it was. I actually loved the plot and was amazed at the contributions they did to the revolution. Home Letters by Fu Lei was another book required to read. But I hated it. I didn’t like how Fu Lei lectured his son, looking all saint and great. It’s alright. I didn’t stop read books after this though. I approached books next with a different mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is also a way of making us look at the bigger world out there, communicating thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or even novels can give readers an inside peek of the authors’ wise brain, learning about their encounters, and reflecting such to the world out there. In Educated, I was there, with Westover, watching her grow up. I saw her change from being oppressed by her family issues to a striving girl and graduating from well-known colleges. She changed for the better. But this made me think: how many children are stuck in the mountains, with their family, like her, unable to receive proper education, never able to walk outside, in the city and look at the world? Tara Westover was just one of them, speaking out for the thousands of people like her. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse through the main character sinclair. I saw him during times of confusion, his dirty moves but also his inner struggle, desperate for help. Immediately, I thought of me, trying my best to keep my head above water, walking in the mist, unable to find the path forward. How many of us feels like this? Confused, desperate to find that beacon leading to success. Grab a book, and you’d be surprised at the themes authors speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Herman Hesse, “the more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness — at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.” Books are so much more than what I just mentioned above. They are the crystallization of the world of thoughts, knowledge, of humanity of literally everything you can think of. It’s amazing how much things can be put in one book waiting for us to devour. But of course, my thoughts don’t represent the thoughts of everyone. So why not start reading yourself? Don’t hesitate! Start flipping through the pages, skimming briefly at the content. Anytime, anywhere, read and discover the beauty within. You’d definitely find something valuable and unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Line of passion</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to start with something common in our lives—books. I don’t know if you could remember properly the first time when you started reading a book. I couldn’t. But that feeling was something I’d always remember. It felt as if we had an immediate bond, and I couldn’t take my eyes off the intricate and fancy pictures. From the soft, fabricated touch of my first book to the scratchy paper and smooth cover of my recent books, I loved reading. I don’t understand passion or love that clearly, but books have been my companions on adventures through time and space, making it a friend worthy of love and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fascination with books was at its peak during elementary school, when I started out with chapter books containing all sorts of fantastical journeys. Reading the books, I’ve solved mysteries alongside Sherlock, Poirot, Drew; travelled to fantastical places with Alex and Connor, Harry and Ron, and Katniss; experienced farm life as a blind person, sought out treasure and been through fights with different characters. These stories gave me a peek into the lives and situations of characters, making my heart flip and turn at obstacles and crying out tears of joy at happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But books are more than just exciting escapes. They&amp;rsquo;re also gateways to knowledge. Although I’m not a big fan of scientific non-fiction books, I have to admit that they are very helpful in learning new knowledge and understanding the thoughts of admirable people. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re curious about history, science, or anything in between, there&amp;rsquo;s a book out there waiting to be explored. By reading, we can learn about the world around us, different cultures, and new ways of thinking. Books on self-control and self-determination has helped me better acknowledge the ways of improving my time management and organization ability. Books on animals and humans taught me more about the development and history, allowing me to acquire more knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading is also a way of communicating thoughts. Reading different books can give us insight to different opinions and thoughts. Reading memoirs, biographies, or just novels can all give readers an inside peek of the authors’ brain, understanding the wisdom of humans. The books I read by Tara Westover and Hermann Hesse were imprinted into my brains. In Educated, I read about the problems and obstacles Westover encountered, I understood her thoughts. I saw her actions when facing violence, facing estrangement and unacceptance; I learned her thoughts when finding out being accepted into colleges, when she finally learned to deal with her family problems. In Demian, however, I saw Hesse. I saw his character, his philosophical theories, and he had an immediate attraction on me. Through him, I started reading and trying more books he wrote, and loved his philosophical and inspiring expressions. The process of reading each book can not only show me the writing styles of authors for me to learn, but it can also reflect their own thoughts that are inspiring to me.
Reading helps. Maybe you’re anxious, maybe you’re unsure of what to do, maybe you feel overwhelmed, or maybe you’re just bored. If so, why not take a chance at reading a book? It can be a great way to relax, filling your mind with wonder and exciting information. Sometimes, diving into a good story can take our minds off our daily troubles and transport us to a different place. Reading might seem not so effective when just starting, but after doing so a long time and looking back, I find it effective in improving my English skills. Nor would it seem fun, but I find enjoyment through the pleasures of reading novels and coming to understand and communicate the symbols and the author’s true purpose with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Herman Hesse, “the more discriminatingly, the more sensitively, and the more associatively we learn to read, the more clearly we see every thought and every poem in its uniqueness, its individuality, in its precise limitations and see that all beauty, all charm depend on this individuality and uniqueness — at the same time we come to realize ever more clearly how all these hundred thousand voices of nations strive toward the same goals, call upon the same gods by different names, dream the same wishes, suffer the same sorrows.” Flipping through the pages and just skimming briefly the content can take you into a new world filled with thoughts of the author, so why not grab a book beside you and give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;
